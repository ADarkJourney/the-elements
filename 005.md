**** Nox ****

The healing had taken a lot more out of him that he'd realized, he knew that it would make him weak but he had needed Aria's assistance to get back to the warehouse.  They'd not talked about what had happened, there really wasn't much to say.  He'd been stupid.  Aria had killed a man for nothing more than existing.  And they let it hang in the air like that - without words they shared their sorrow.

He could have died.  Nox knew that.  Knew that if Aria hadn't let the man heal him, hadn't let Dorian kill him in her stead.  He could be dead, instead he was lying in his bed with a beautiful woman passed out next to him.  Normally that would mean he was naked and had enjoyed himself.  While the latter was true, he had enjoyed the hunt, it wasn't that type of enjoyment.  Aria had stayed the night with him.  The only body parts that touch were the tips of their fingers.  An entire night.  It always amazed him how they managed that, and how well they both slept.  

He kept her nightmares away, and she his.  It was peaceful, and while Aria had talked to Lucas for several hours, she hadn't wanted him to see her with blood on her hands. Not literally of course, but she had showered three times, and taken a long bath before she'd come into his room looking full of saddness.  It took a toll on her - killing that man, and then keeping it from Lucas.  She loved him, hated keeping secrets from him.  But the harsher side of her life he knew little of - and he was fairly certain she'd never tell him.  No that was his burden to bear with her.  He would take the deaths to his grave.  He had his own blood on his hands afterall.  Accidental yet, but still on his hands.  

Nox had pushed his alarm silent and lay awake his fingers touching Aria's she had barely stirred with the sounding of the alarm.  Neither of them wanting to acknowledge that a new day had dawned, a man was dead and they had to move on.  Had reports to file.  Things to do.  But they laid in bed pretending the world didn't exist.  It was a good morning.

By the time they had risen for the day the sun was well pass noon.  Aria's stomach had rumbled loudly and she decided food was necessary.  The night had been restful despite the prior days events.  It would have been tinged with nightmares if she'd spent it alone.  Lucas was calming but he wouldn't understand her desire not to talk about it.  He always wanted to help to protect her, but he couldn't protect her from herself.  Couldn't stay her hand when she killed an innocent man to preserve her own life.  She would go to confession and see forgiveness, but that would be hard enough,  Aria needed to find an Atharim priest that she'd trust.  She couldn't keep telling normal men her secrets, they would surely turn her in with anonomity.  Killing a man was a mortal sin.  She was damned to hell for it.  But it was her life.  

No matter the wrongness of the deed Aria couldn't shake the pure pleasure she had taken from the dagger sliding perfectly into place releiving the man of his life.  Severing the times of thought from him, killing him with percision.  He swallowed away the thoughts as she made lunch for her and Nox.

It was a lazy day, neither of them were in the mood for much.  But the mood they both were in saw them in the dojo trading blows.  Back and forth they'd take the lead.  Nox was powerful in his own right, his tall frame was strong and he made sure he grew stronger every day.  He had confided in her that he'd never enjoyed hand to hand until he met her.  His form had been non-existant when they started, now he was flawless in form, in a fight he still had his weakneses, but even she knew she had some, everyone did and she'd been fighting since she could walk.

Nox could not kill her in hand to hand yet, but he was getting here.  They were training for every eventuality.  The day when Aria was beyond control, where even incapacitating her would not kill her desire to seek pain and punishement and sufferent of the human race.  The world was such a dark place, yet no one ever saw it's underbelly, but Aria lived with every emotion upon her soul.  Every good thing weighed on her body, the evils of the world dragged her under the water.  It was her life.  And she fought everyday to be the person she knew she was.  But it was getting harder and harder as the hunt for gods takes the forefront.  Her handler being the highest Archangel, he was pushing her towards the ends of it.  It was hard to take the life of the innocent for her own survivablity.  She would have to find a solution to the problem.  But for now she hoped that Borovsky was happy and would leave her to her own means.

Their training was interrupted by a knock on the warehouse door.  Aurora yelled from the kitchen, "I'll get it."  It was rare for her to be home, but it allowed them to continue with their fighting.  Aria felt a familiar presense but didn't immediately recognize it as Nox threw a punch leaving a hole wide open.  Aria smiled as she took advantage and found Nox lying on the ground underneath her knee.  "That's probably enough for now.  Your body is sitll weak from the healing."

Aria looked at the man standing in the archway to the dojo.  Dorian Vega.  He wore lazy smile and what Aria now concidered his hunter gear, jeans and a t-shirt.  Aria offered Nox a hand to help him up but he refused it and lay back on the ground staring up at the ceiling panting.  Aria turned to their new friend, "Next time call ahead.  Aurora doesn't like surprise guests."  It wasn't just Aurora who didn't like surprise guests, none of them did, not with what they did in the dojo.  Aria could only hope that Aurora would not have given away their secrets to a strange man she didn't know.  Aria heard the front door shut softly and Aurora's presence leaving the vicinity.  Aria sighed, she was giving them a wide breath ever since she'd taken up with that man.  A man no one knew.  It was concerning but now they had other problems to deal with.
