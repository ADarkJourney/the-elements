**** Aria ****

Aria didn't like being included in hunting for gods.  It was a major conflict of interest for her.  Her bestfriend was a godling.  She had let too many live, and had only killed one, and been the cause of another, yet she sat in this prestigious group of hunters because Dorian Vega saw it fit that she be there.  For whatever reason she had no clue.  Just another tool to be used.  Aria was almost warming up to Nox and Lucas perspectives, but she was what she was.  Everyone here save for Nox had made a name for themselves in the Atharim.

Dorian was a good hunter, a good leader, but he had a good teacher do it had not surprised her.  Martin Borovsky demanded the best of his recruits and his teams.  Even Antoinette had made a name for herself, the hunters of the female persuasion usually didn't hunt, her and Jacinda being pretty rare, and to live this long too.  

Vincent was not such a name that a hunter revered.  He was the man you whispered about in the shadows because you feared him.  He was a theif by trade, but he was a self proclaimed bad man.  He let you know he was not nice, and he was a perfectionist.  Everything went this way, or he'd have to redo it.  It was one reason why their spar back in the early days had gone on so long.  They both strove for the same perfection, the only thing that had allowed Aria to get the advantage was the fact that they both grew tired and their form was flawed.  It was only a matter of time before Vincent would have had the upper hand.

The three Old World hunters were part of the crew that Aria had idolized growing up, wanting to be them.  Knowing she never would, and now she sat here in the same breifing as them and Aria had a horrible pit inside her stomach.  Antoinette's feelings towards here were biting into Aria's shields.  The one person who had stuck up for her back when she was younger hated her, hated what she was, wanted her dead.  To say it stung was an understaement.  Aria clung to the safety net that Nox had become.  The hatred welling up inside threatening to pull the darkness forward.  The need to pull at her own fear and suffering.  

Leaving at the end was the easiest thing Aria had done all morning.  But before she could leave Antoinette called to her.  She'd figured something out, figured out why Aria was there.  And she was proud of herself, the venom was replaced with retribution.  She was happy Aria was sent to her death.  Aria had given her the only answer Antoinette had needed.  Goodie for her, she was happy now.  Maybe the rest of the hunt would go off with less emotional pull.

When Aria got back to the warehouse she didn't say anything to Nox, they hadn't spoken a word since the meeting had started.  Aria went to her room and locked her bedroom door and turned her wallet off.  Aria contimplated the dagger at her wrist, the pain it could inflict, the desire to hurt herself was drawing deeping again, she felt like the 10 year old who'd once cut her self to stay sane.  

But Aria removed her weapons and ran a cold bath.  When the tub was full nearly to the rim Aria took off her combat boots, and stepped into the freezing water and sank down to the floor of the cast iron tub.  Submerged the world sank away.  There was nothing but the still calm of nothingness.  Minutes, hours, an enterinty of nothingness before Aria came back up for air, only to repeat the process.  It was a cleansing ritual she'd not done in months.  Lucas and Nox had pulled her into a place of comfort and the woman she'd looked up to her entire life pulled it in around her, her new world crashing in on her.

She heard a knock, or thought she had when she rose from the freezing cold water.  She took a longer breath and listened.  The knock came again. But she could hardly hear it, and she could feel Nox's fustration on the otherside.

She got out of the water and walked, soaking wet and leaving a trail of water across the tile and wooden floor that would make the floor dangerously wet and unlocked the door.  Aria turned back the way she'd come and started back towards the bathroom, he'd open the door the next time he tried.  

Aria got back in the tub and started again.  Shallow breath, submerge.
