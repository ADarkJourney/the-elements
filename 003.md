**** Dorian ****

Not everything goes according to plan, and in the case of causing landslides they really should have anticipated this.  Well maybe Nox had.  He seemed the type to take on risks without much regard to himself.  That was a sad way to live life if it was true.

Aria hadn't been happy when he'd gone to her and told her he would die honorably if she could kill the god they were after.  Insenstivie probably, but the truth.  And she seemed like the type of person who wanted the truth.  

Dorian had watched Aria run off and pick up speed as she did.  Spurred out of fear, real fear maybe?  But who knew with a girl who could manipulate emotions, maybe everything she felt was someone elses.  He didn't know.  And Dorian wasn't sure he wanted to know either. 

But as he knelt by Nox he couldn't help but feel a stab of guilt.  He was breathing, but beyond that he didn't really want to move him, or touch him.  Nox looked like he was sleeping, but the part of the ceilng that had fallen on him, had caused a huge gash in his cheek and the side of his head.  Dorian was using his denim shirt to stop as much of the bleeding as he could.  Stupid boy! 

Why had he let them do this?  A sniper shot could have been enough.  He blamed himself for this.  A promising young man dead because Martin wanted to see what the girl had in her.  No he blamed Martin for this.  He would have words with his friend if the boy didn't make it through this.  But really he was angry at himself.  He was the senior member here.  Why was that anyway?  Because he was older, had Borovsky as friend.  Together these two had more time than he had as Atharim.

Doubt was the reigning emotion he had right now.  All to kill one man, a boy could die.  Dorian sighed and wished time away.  He didn't know how long he wallowed as a man came up behind him with Aria panting behind him.  

He spoke in heavy Russian accent, "What happened, comrade?"

Dorian sighed, "He was playing hero, he was trying to get a cat out of the rocks, maybe it was a rat, I don't know but it's gone now.  He shifted a rock and well you see he results."

Dorian stood up out of the way, Aria stood behind the man and watched him.  Dorian watched her watch him.  When she didn't move to kill the man Dorian reached in his sleeve to pull out his own knife.  But Aria moved and caught his arm and shook her head.  She mouthed, "Wait!"

What was she waiting for.  He saw the hilt of a dagger in the palm of her hand.  She was waiting for something.  He couldn't for the life of him imagine what it was she was waiting on.  Kill him he willed her, he didn't want to kill her too.
