**** Dorian ****

Dorian found himself drapped with a blanket on the couch where he'd fallen asleep in a pair of young Atharim's living arrangement.  He felt wildly out of place.  He glanced at his wallet and saw that he had a few messages from Martin, and that it was 4am.  He found he had to releive himself and he had no idea where to go.

He got up from the couch which was surprisingly comfortable, no wonder he'd fallen asleep.  Dorian wandered around the back where he thought he saw someone moving, at 4am?  Dorian was surprised to see Aria moving fluidly through motions of a kata.  He didn't recognize it, but then again there were probably millions of forms and he'd not recognize them all.  Aria smiled at him.

He whispered loudly so she could hear from the distance, "Facilities?"

Aria stopped what she was doing and walked towards him.  He could see her forehead was slick with sweat, how long had she been up?  

She walked into a room next to the stairs that lead up. "You can use mine."  

She flipped on the light and Dorian blinked at the large Toaist painting on the wall.  It spoke of serenity and he stared out it in awe.  "Wow."

She smiled.  "Through that door.  I know, impressive isn't it?  Lucas painted it."

Dorian whistled softly, "I'd like to meet him someday.  Damn good artist."

Aria laughed, "He prefers to work on human skin.  This was done special."

Dorian nodded and understood.  "He did your's I take it."

Aria nodded, "Re-inked it yes, he did Nox's completely.  He's good at what he does."

"I can imagine."  Dorian was impressed.  "Mind if I grab a shower."  He felt the grime of the bar still on him.  He hated that feeling and surprised he'd lasted this long with it on his skin.

Aria nodded, "Yeah sure.  I'll grab a clean shirt from Nox's, it should fit.  And he'll never notice it's missing as long as it's not got one of his stupid sayings on it."

Dorian laughed, "Thanks."  Though it wasn't exactly what was on his mind at the time.  He really had to kick this kid out of his head.  

Aria's bathroom was just as elegant as her room.  The blue and cream times made it serene.  The tub was absolutely gorgeous.  He was still checking out the detail of the tile work on the walls when Aria set a towel and one of Nox's shirts on the sink.  "That's Nox's handywork.  I'm sure he didn't paint it, but he did the tile work, and chose the colors."

Dorian looked confused, "You didn't do any of the design work?  How strange for a girl."

Aria laughed.  "It was a surprise, and if I had any say in the matter it would probably be pretty drab.  You shoulda seen my last apartment."  She turned and left closing the door behind her.  He was left alone in complete silence.  He couldn't hear anything except the echo of his own feet on the floor and he almost thought he could hear his own heartbeat.

Dorian took a look at his wallet and read the messages from Martin.  The first was just notification that he'd sent the files on the mission to his email.  The second however was most interesting, it was sent over a series of messages.  "I do have a favor to ask.  There is an American who has recently come across to us.  She is reputable.  Take her with you, assess her and give me a report.  I will warn you, she does't appear to work in teams well."

Dorian sighed as he looked at the name on the file he'd sent him.  Jacinda Cross.  He'd heard the name.  One of the oldest hunters alive because of her cold hard demeanor and her knack for getting the job done no matter what.  But American reports were not like their European counterparts.  The American's were lack luster in organization.  Hardly a challenege most of the time.  But he'd do what he was asked.

He had contact information for her.   Dorian sent her a text.  "God Hunting - Meet me at HQ @ 8am - DV"  And he sent along with that directions to the little room Aria used for her research.  It was the safest place to meet he thought.  

He also sent a message to two people he'd worked with before.  To meet him at the same place at the same time.  Antoinette Cailot, had worked with Aria before, and he liked her no-nonsense attitude.  She was pratical in application.  And her field work was explemorary.  The last party member was Vincent Auclair, a man of ill repute, he would be able to get into places they needed to get into with ease.  Dorian liked working with him despite his need to have control of everything.

Dorian got his shower in and he felt 100% better.  He looked at Nox's shirt sitting atop the sink and sighed, he pulled it over, the red shirt was slightly faded, but it fit well.  It was probably lose on Nox, his frame was much smaller than Dorian's.  And it smelled like him.  He was not soon going to forget the gnawing feeling in his gut about him. 

Dorian found Nox in the kitchen making a pot of coffee.  Nox smirked, then yelled.  "Aria!  Why didn't you wake me up when you took the shirt from my room?"

Dorian heard her laugh from the dojo.  But she didn't say anything to his comment.  "You mind?"  

Nox shook his head.  "Nah, just messing with Aria."

"Since you are all up, mind meeting at HQ for a quick meet and greet of the team, we'll meet back here for full briefing and planning.  Your sister won't mind?"  Dorian didn't want to make matters worse for the blonde he'd briefly met.

Nox shook his head.  "Aurora left a note, said she won't be back for a while.  We'll order food and can make a night of it."

Dorian nodded, "8am, Aria's little office.  See you there."

And with that Dorian headed for the metro.  He was sure he was making a mistake with something but right now he didn't care.
