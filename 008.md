**** Aria ****

Aria didn't like being included in hunting for gods.  It was a major conflict of interest for her.  Her bestfriend was a godling.  She had let too many live, and had only killed one, and been the cause of another, yet she sat in this prestigious group of hunters because Dorian Vega saw it fit that she be there.  For whatever reason she had no clue.  Just another tool to be used.  Aria was almost warming up to Nox and Lucas perspectives, but she was what she was.  Everyone here save for Nox had made a name for themselves in the Atharim.

Dorian was a good hunter, a good leader, but he had a good teacher do it had not surprised her.  Martin Borovsky demanded the best of his recruits and his teams.  Even Antoinette had made a name for herself, the hunters of the female persuasion usually didn't hunt, her and Jacinda being pretty rare, and to live this long too.  

Vincent was not such a name that a hunter revered.  He was the man you whispered about in the shadows because you feared him.  He was a theif by trade, but he was a self proclaimed bad man.  He let you know he was not nice, and he was a perfectionist.  Everything went this way, or he'd have to redo it.  It was one reason why their spar back in the early days had gone on so long.  They both strove for the same perfection, the only thing that had allowed Aria to get the advantage was the fact that they both grew tired and their form was flawed.  It was only a matter of time before Vincent would have had the upper hand.

The three Old World hunters were part of the crew that Aria had idolized growing up, wanting to be them.  Knowing she never would, and now she sat here in the same breifing as them and Aria had a horrible pit inside her stomach.  Antoinette's feelings towards here were biting into Aria's shields.  The one person who had stuck up for her back when she was younger hated her, hated what she was, wanted her dead.  To say it stung was an understatement.  Aria clung to the safety net that Nox had become.  The hatred welling up inside threatening to pull the darkness forward.  The need to pull at her own fear and suffering.  

Leaving at the end was the easiest thing Aria had done all morning.  But before she could leave Antoinette called to her.  She'd figured something out, figured out why Aria was there.  And she was proud of herself, the venom was replaced with retribution.  She was happy Aria was sent to her death.  Aria had given her the only answer Antoinette had needed.  Goodie for her, she was happy now.  Maybe the rest of the hunt would go off with less emotional pull.

When Aria got back to the warehouse she didn't say anything to Nox, they hadn't spoken a word since the meeting had started.  Aria went to her room and locked her bedroom door and turned her wallet off.  Aria contimplated the dagger at her wrist, the pain it could inflict, the desire to hurt herself was drawing deeping again, she felt like the 10 year old who'd once cut her self to stay sane.  

But Aria removed her weapons and ran a cold bath.  When the tub was full nearly to the rim Aria took off her combat boots, and stepped into the freezing water and sank down to the floor of the cast iron tub.  Submerged the world sank away.  There was nothing but the still calm of nothingness.  Minutes, hours, an enterinty of nothingness before Aria came back up for air, only to repeat the process.  It was a cleansing ritual she'd not done in months.  Lucas and Nox had pulled her into a place of comfort and the woman she'd looked up to her entire life pulled it in around her, her new world crashing in on her.

She heard a knock, or thought she had when she rose from the freezing cold water.  She took a longer breath and listened.  The knock came again. But she could hardly hear it, and she could feel fustration on the otherside, her senses were too erratic to know exactly who it was, and at that particular moment she didn't care.

She got out of the water and walked, soaking wet and leaving a trail of water across the tile and wooden floor that would make the floor dangerously wet and unlocked the door.  Aria turned back the way she'd come and started back towards the bathroom, they'd open the door the next time he tried.  

Aria got back in the tub and started again.  Shallow breath, submerge.

**** Lucas ****

Lucas hadn't been worried. Aria wasn't answering again but he remembered when Aria had gone missing the first time. He had been worried but she had come back to him ok. Better than ok. That had been their first night together. It was better than anything he had experienced. When she came something snapped inside her and he felt her joy and pleasure and contentment reflect back to him, felt his own pleasure and love flow to her, cycling in some kind of loop. He'd never felt so connected to someone- known and loved. After a lifetime of feeling alienated and different- despite intellectually knowing it wasn't true- to actually feel what another felt for him...it was pure bliss.

She had climbed into his brain so that now, a portion of his mind was her, he was always talking to her, sharing with her, thinking of everything of life he wanted to experience with her. So he missed her. But he trusted her. Trusted that she was safe.

Still it had been a while and he wanted to see her. He texted Nox and he said they were at their place. He got on his motorcycle- finally something he could ride now that the worst of winter had passed- and was at their place in no time.

But Nox wasn't in a bantering mood, which was different for him. Oh he tried to joke and such, but it was more forced. Lucas' hackles began to rise. "Where's Aria?"

Nox nodded to the door. "She's been in there for hours.  Won't answer the door.  Maybe you'll have better luck.  We've another hunt coming up.  Her past hit hard today."

Lucas grimaced, his memory of their first evening together, when he'd drawn her the image, came to him. Learning of how isolated she'd been. His heart broke for her. He went to the door and knocked. No answer. He knocked a few more times, then turned and asked Nox if he had a key. Before he could answer he heard a click. But the door remained shut. He looked at it for a moment and then tried the knob. It opened. There was a trail of water on the wood floor leading to the bathroom. He closed the door and walked to the bathroom.

There was Aria, fully clothed at the bottom of the deep tub, under the water, eyes shut. He panicked and heedless of his jacket thrust his hands in to pull her out. Aria clasped his hands and pulled frantically at them before she broke the surface with a gasp of air.  Her eyes popped open with a panicked look before the water cleared and she saw who he was. "Aria! What are you doing? Are you ok?" He looked over her form, looked for any injuries or ribbens of red in the water. The water streamed around her hair and face but her green eyes shone.

"Fuck Lucas don't do that."  She stopped and looked down.  "Sorry, please don't do that again.  You scared me." 

He stared into her eyes, incredulous. "I scared you?!? You're under the water in your clothes! What are you doing?" His eyes softened and he hesitantly reached out a hand to touch her cheek. "Aria, I'm worried about you."

Aria pulled back from his touch and reached for the towel that hung nearby.  "I was destroying the feelings inside me."  She didn't look at him.  "Drowning away the pain.  I wasn't in any danger.  I'm not going to kill myself."

He looked at her for a moment while she toweled off her face. He felt helpless. It wasn't often that he was presented with her struggle. In truth, after than first evening together- and later when getting the tattoo itself and she needed a breather- it wasn't something that came up often. When she did call, as she did when they went to Mass, it was mostly her just wanting to listen to him. That somehow he was calming her.

But she needed more. He stood and moved back, so she could get up if she wanted to. He stifled the male need to just pull her to him or comfort her. Her shieing away from his touch said she wasn't ready for that. But he did look at her tenderly. "I do love you Aria. I'll be in the other room when you feel up to it." He didn't want to leave her. And he wasn't. Still, it took every ounce of strength to head for the bathroom door.

Before he got a step away she grabbed his arm, "You don't have to go."  Aria stepped out of the bath tub and pulled the plug, then sank to the floor her arms wrapped around her knees pulled up agaisnt her chest.  She spoke softly, he could barely hear what she said, "I saw my mentor today.  Someone who I looked up to growing up.  She knows what I am now.  She was spewing venom like a hissing snake.  Nothing could pull me back."  She looked up at him with tears streaming down her face.  "I felt 10 years old again.  I wanted to..."  She swallowed hard, like she was chocking on the words, "do worse things than drown the sorrows away.  I left my weapons in there so I couldn't."

His heart physically hurt. He sat down next to her, heedless of the water seeping into his jeans. He put his arm around her. She tensed but she didn't move away this time. He didn't pull her to him. Just let the feel of his body and arm try to warm her, to let her know he was there.

Inside he seethed and tried to stifle it. He prayed and took deep breaths. Aria needed calm, not his righteous anger. He looked at her tiny form and felt protective calm and love, focused on that, on his hope for her happiness and joy. It seemed to work. The negative feelings that had threatened to overwhelm him drifted away. His other arm went around her and he just held her. "I'm sorry Aria." It was all he could think to say. But he hoped she felt his love for her.

Silence followed, he didn't know how long, her small laugh startled him, "She was happy when I told her I was meant to die."  She leaned in to him.  "I'm sorry I worried you."

"Never apologize for that. I like worrying about you." After a few moments, "Let's get you out of those freezing clothes." He stood and gave her his hand. 

***** Aria ****

She looked up at him with a grim smile but she took his hand.  Aria didn't feel any better, if anything she felt worse, Lucas was trying very hard to be calm.  She felt his emotions go from up to down and steady but still he wanted to protect her.

Aria let him help get the wet clothes off, her limbs didn't exactly want to work anyway from the cold water. Once in a dry t-shirt and shorts she felt slightly better, but all she wanted to was curl up and die still.  

Lucas was patient, he waited for her sitting on the bed, heedless of his own wet jeans.  She could feel him, she focused on him and what he meant to her.  She stood in front of him with nothing left in her.

He stood and enfolded her in a tight hug, breathing her in. They just stood like that for minutes, he allowing her to take strength and comfort from him. Then he reached down and lifted her up into his arms and carried her to the side of the bed and gently put her in it. He took off his wet jeans and got in with her. Then he just held her, both of them under the covers, felt her cold limbs begin to warm. And then he held her some more.

Aria lost track of time, but even though she focused on Lucas, she could feel Nox in the background.  She was calm now but he was not.  And she was thirsty.  Aria rolled over and smiled at Lucas.  "You know what you mean to me?"

She kissed him softly.  "Thank you.  I'm not sure I deserve you."

He smiled at her and brushed a strand of hair from her face, his silver blue eyes lost her her emerald ones. "God brought us together. He thinks we deserve each other."

She smiled at him, "I hope you are right.  But Nox is going to drive me crazy.  Can you tell him I'm okay.  He's in the gym, pissed off and fustrated.  And he's going to undo what you just fixed if he doesn't calm down.  I don't want to explain things, not yet."

He smiled at her. "Yeah. You got it." He got up and padded in his boxers out to the other room. Nox was attacking a punching bag but stopped when he drew close. "She's ok, but still in a bad place. She can feel your anger out here and its making it tough for her."

Nox frowned, "She is okay though?"

"Yeah, for now. I got her calmed. But I guess your mood is sort of spilling over into her." He put a hand on Nox's shoulder. "This is your house, man. I'd not ask you to leave. Just letting you know."

Nox laughed, "You don't have to.  I'll go for a long walk.  Better than a drink right now."

Lucas laughed. "Yeah, I know what you mean. That was me for a long time. Thanks man." He went back to the room- swiping a bottle of water on the way- and climbed into bed with her. "He's gonna go for a walk." He handed her the water. "Good?"

She grinned up at him, "Yeah, good.  He disappeared the moment you said something."  Aria knew that Nox was walking for his own sake not hers.  Aria had been in water for hours, she shouldn't feel so thirsty but she did.  She took a long swallow.  "Thank you."  She tipped the bottle to indicate it was part of it, "For everything."  She set it down on the side of the bed and curled up into Lucas's arms.  "As much as I'd like more, I don't think I can do more.  I don't want to hurt you.  And we've a plane to catch at 8 AM."

He raised an eyebrow as if wanting to test her. His hands even moved playfully over her body. Aria stifled a moan before it escaped, she really couldn't go there right now.  She was barely containing herself now.  But then he stilled them and pulled her to him so that he could feel every inch of her. "I'm content." Then after a moment. "Can I come?"

Aria sighed, "That wouldn't be a good idea.  I don't want you anywhere near these guys.  And we are hunting gods."  She squeezed his hand, "I wish you could, I don't think Dorian would want a civilian along, particularly one tied to me."

He sighed. "Alright. Well you have to call me then." His arms went around her stomach and then he just relaxed.

Aria smiled, but knew he couldn't see, "I will call you every chance I get.  I'm sure Mr. Rich Fancy Pants isn't going to be far from civilization at any point in time."  She laughes softly.  "A private plane to the Netherlands because Dorian's father is concerned Dorian isn't sending enough of his company's money."

She felt his body stir with silent laughter. "And I just get to stay home. We could have some fun in a fancy hotel. Silk sheets? Threadcounts and all that." He nipped at her ear. "I guess I'll make do and hang out with Sergei."

Aria laughed more, but she tried to sound sorry for leaving him behind, "I'm sorry.  Have to be a good little hunter, our lives depend on it."  She closed her eyes and sighed with contentment, "I'll make it up to you when I get back."

His hands played again. "You better" he whispered with a growl.

Aria drifted off to sleep in Lucas arms content with the knowledge that he was always there for her.
