**** Nox ****

Nox hadn't remembered falling asleep.  He remembered kissing Dorian and being drowsy from everything that had happened, but falling asleep he had no recollection.   Dorian's arm was drapped over his chest and his partially clothed body was pressed up against Nox's at what had to be an awkward angle.  The morning light seeped through the window, he wondered what time it was.  And why he was still sleeping, it was rare the sun was up before him.  

Nox watched Dorian sleep for a while, a small smile turned on the other man's lips and Nox pressed a kissed lightly too it, "Morning," Nox whispered.

Dorian opened his eyes, "Well, I take it as a good sign you are still in my bed in the morning."

Nox grinned playfully at him, "A first for me."  He leaned over and kissed Dorian, "And hopefully more to come."

Dorian smiled and rolled over on top of Nox pinning him, Nox swallowed as he felt the man's weight on top of him.  It wasn't fear that coursed through his body, aprehension, angst.  He wanted more, his body reacted but Nox was not sure.  Dorian smiled and kissed Nox's neck up his ear and nibbled at his ear, "Easy.  Nothing more, I promise."  Nox relaxed a little, and Dorian smiled against his neck, "If it's too much, tell me."

Nox nodded, his voice failing him as Dorian kissed and nipped at his neck.  Dorian smiled each time he reacted and continued the onslaught.  Dorian pulled up on his elbows and looked down at Nox with a smile that said Dorian was completely enjoying himself, "I love that you react to me.  I know it's hard for you to let go."  Dorian leaned his head against Nox's forehead and smiled, "We'll get there.  There is no rush."

Nox lifted his head and kissed Dorian. There were no words for it.  Unfortunately it left both of them slightly fustrated for all the implied movements, the deeds that did not happen.  Dorian rolled off to the side and sat up and grabbed a towel from the nightstand, "Grab a shower.  We have some work to do."

Nox grinned and sat up and crawled over behind Dorian and wrapped his arms around him, "You are too patient, thank you."  Nox kissed Dorian's neck.  

Dorian gave Nox an appreciative moan and grabbed the towel and tossed it into his face, "Shower, cariño, or you'll drive me even more crazy."

Nox grinned and sat next to Dorian as he scooted off the bed and stood before him, "What's cariño mean?"  Nox knew he probably butchered the Spanish, he'd get better.  

Dorian smiled, "Just a term of endearment.  Like honey or darling."

Nox smiled happily, "I can live with that.  Thank you D, for understanding."

Dorian nodded and stood up and playfully shoved Nox in the direction of the bathroom, "Anything for you.  Now. Shower."

Nox laughed, "Alright, alright.  I'm going."  He grinned playfully, "Pushy much?"  Before Dorian could get another word in Nox shut the bathroom door.  Nox's heart was pounding in his chest, his pants were tight and he knew why Dorian wanted him to go away, he needed as much down time as Nox did right that moment.  Cold shower? or...

Nox finally looked at the bathroom and was not overly surprised to see marble tiles and countertops with a double shower with glass doors that weren't those cheeze speckled kinds, full view of everything inside.  Nox sighed, there was alot more than just the intimate parts he was going to have to get used to if he was going to date Dorian... date... such a foreign and childish word.

Nox undressed and got into the shower and turned on the water, it was cold at first and perfect for other issues, but it warmed slowly and Nox grabbed the shampoo bottle and smelled the distinct scent of Dorian in it.  He thought, well why not?

Ten minutes later Nox was toweling off and walking out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist, he looked up from drying his hair and didn't see Dorian, but there was a note on the bed.  Nox grabbed his bag of things before he picked up the note, dropping the bag in it's place.  In Dorian's neat handwriting, "Showering down the hall, use whatever you need. - D"

Nox smiled and folded the letter and put it carefully in the side panel of his bag and got dressed.  As he was dressing he noticed a crumpled up bag folded neatly in the other side pocket.  Nox grabbed it after button his jeans.  Nox couldn't say the name on the bag, but it smelled like the lavender and other things Lillian had said she was refilling.  Nox smiled, but he couldn't read the ingredients, Aria would be able to help he hoped.  He didn't want to have to ask Dorian.  Nox tucked the bag back in the side pocket and grabbed a blue t-shire and started to pull it over his head as he walked out the door.  Barefoot, Nox padded his way downstairs to find coffee!
