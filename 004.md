**** Dorian ****

They had left the underground in a completely different path than they had arrived.  This way was cleaner, and smelled far better.  Next time he'll let them do the planning for the meeting place if he were to come down here again. Which Dorian didn't think was likely to happen. 

The exit was actually pretty close to the Ritz, he was surprised.  When they parted ways, Aria was helping Nox with his long lanky weight, his energy level had slowly drained away as they had traversed the levels.  

The man at the door to the Ritz gave him the once over, it wasn't until Dorian spoke that the man recognized him.  Apparently there weren't many men staying with a Spanish accent.  Dorian couldn't help but grin, Nox's default state becoming infectious even as he looked horrible, he'd kept his spirits high.

His room smelled of perfection, the fresh pressed sheets on his bed, turned over just right.  The mints on the pillow accenting the greens in the comforter.  Dorian took off his hunter gear and tossed it aside, the maid would pick it up later.  But Dorian was too tired, he fell down on top of the bed naked and fell asleep.  He'd forgotten how much he hated walking in the dark damp tunnels of the underground, oh yeah, that's right, he hadn't ever done that before, but now he knew, now he knew how much he hated it.

Morning came and Dorian found that he had slept on top of the covers all night long, he was still covered in dirt and grime but his clothes from the night before had been removed.  The maid must have had an eyefull.  

Dorian showered and sat down and wrote his report.  A report that would detail the events as they happened.  No opinions just the facts.  Dorian would tell Martin his opinions but he would not make them official record.  He didn't want to be branded a traitor, but he beleived Martin would at least listen to him, even if he didn't take heart what he said, he would listen.

The report was simple, his hand elegantly scripted the prose.  Handwriting in today's day and age was something most people lacked, but everything his father had demanded was perfection, and that was something Dorian did for appearances.  He strived for perfection.  He sighed as he signed his name.  It was done, now to speak with Martin.  It was only noon, Martin would still be hip deep in the politics of his new position.

**** Martin ****

It was ten to three in the afternoon when Maria told Martin that Dorian was there to see him.  He wasn't exactly expecting to see his friend so soon.  Maybe the girl had balked and put an end to the mission before it even started.  

He told his secretary to let him in, Dorian walked into his office with a manilla envelope and wearing jeans and a t-shirt.  Dorian was in hunter gear, Martin wondered what the significance of it was and quirked an eyebrow at his friend.

Dorian laughed.  "I've been told I should dress the occassion."  His friend sat down opposite him and pushed the envelope towards him.  "My report."

Martin was confused, "She's dead?"

Dorian shook his head with a wry mryth in his eyes.  "Of course not.  She did the job quickly."

Martin opened the envelope and read his friend's report.  It was like any other report he ever read.  And when added to Aria's file it would fit in just perfectly.  Her record intact, her ability to kill a god established.  But when Martin looked up to Dorian, he knew the man had more to say.  "Well spit it out before you turn sour."

Dorian frowned.  "I'm hesitant to with in the walls of the Atharim, Martin.  It is not treason I wish to speak, but my opinions are that of a friend, not as an Atharim."

Martin glanced at his watch.  "Let us get that drink then, my old friend.  I can work later."

Dorian nodded and stood waiting for Martin to close down his computer.  His friend was casually dressed, he had anticipated this.  Dorian was anot a predictable man, but apparently Martin was.

It was a comfortable silence as they walked to the nearest bar, there were other hunters in the bar, he nodded to a few of them, and the rest just nodded to him with deference.  Dorian ordered some exotic beer and sat down in a booth far from prying ears.  Whatever he had to say he wanted to make sure it was for Martin's ears only.  That was concerning.  Martin couldn't imagine what he had to say that was so controversial.

Dorian didn't say anything until their drinks arrived.  Martin had ordered a scotch on the rocks.  He sipped at it as the serving girl left them to their conversation.  Dorian leaned forward, "I speak this as a friend Martin, not as collegue or as your underling, as your friend."

Dorian had stressed friend each time, he knew whatever this was it couldn't be good.  Martin nodded, "I understand."

Dorian nodded.  "I think you are wrong."

Martin laughed.  "I'm wrong?  In what?"

Dorian sighed, "In having the girl sent to her death.  You are losing a valuable tool.  She knows she goes to her death, and she still does the job.  Yesterday, her and the boy, they formulated a plan to take the healer out that would have spared any injuries save for the healer.  But I didn't think that was what you had wanted.  That wasn't the test you wished. I inisisted it be up close and personal."

Martin took another sip as he listened to Dorian regail the tale of their mission.  "She slipped her dagger into the base of the man's skull.  There was no hesitation Martin.  None.  She did what she was supposed to.  She may be a monster, but she IS Atharim."  Dorian smiled to lessen the next blow, "And you are an idiot to discount the boy.  Together they are deadly Martin.  They work well together, they ARE Atharim."

Martin kept in mind that Dorian was speaking as his friends not as someone subject to his authority.  It was hard not to jump down his throat with accusations of being a traitor, of falling into her traps.  As if Dorian had anticipated it he nodded, "I never once let her touch me.  And the boy, well..."  Martin understood the lapse of judgement on the boy.  He would let it be.  

The bottom of his scotch was a swallow away and Martin drank it quickly before he smiled.  "I will keep it all in mind Dorian.  Your opinions as my friend.  Now as my underling."

Martin watched the fight go from Dorian, he was resigned to the fact that Martin was not happy with his words.  "If you feel this strongly about the pair.  Taken them on your next mission."  Dorian's eyes perked up and the frown no longer creased his face in a sad way.  "There is a goddess making a mess in the Netherlands.  I was going to dispatch you with a team of my chosing.  Instead I will trust you to choose your own."
