**** Vincent ****

The holoscreen the Kid had spun up on the plane had been very beneficial, they had an actual plan of action before hitting the ground running.  They'd not have known to check the warehouse out.  Vin was glad he didn't get stuck with the little song as his back up, she was good in a fight, he was sure of that but he didn't like the idea of only a monster at his back.  Even though he thought of himself as a monster at times too.  Such was life, everyone had their limits.

Dorian sitting next to him on the landing had been rough, but it probably would have been rougher if the kid hadn't gotten it together.  Vin found it odd that the kid didn't know how to do what D walked him through.  Aria had tried to teach him and had failed, it made sense too once Dorian explained it to her.  He used it everyday, a life saving mechanism.  He'd noticed that she didn't walk around completely in that emotionless state as she had when she was younger.  So clearly her control was better, but he still didn't want her at his back being the only one there.  He'd much rather have Red anyway.

When the plane halted Aria insured Nox stayed sitting, and the stewardess were jostled out of the way when Vin got out of the plane.  He shook his body like he'd exerted himself but it was just releasing the tension of the place.  Not everything had been to his liking though it could have been worse.

Red was the first one off after him.  She pulled those fancy sunglasses down over her eyes as she stepped out of the doorway to the plane.  She walked over to him, "So hotel, then to our side of town?"

Vin nodded, "Sure thing Red, but I need a smoke now."  He pulled out his pack and lit a smoke and pulled on it, it had been too long.  He blew a puff of smoke into the wind and it carried over to Red.  She glared at him, it was an accident really, "Oh where you standing there?"  But he couldn't let her know that.

The little song was next followed by the kid, some color had returned to his face and hands.  Dorian was following behind him, putting a cold beer over the kid's shoulder.  Vin laughed to himself, "D's got it bad."

Red turned to see what he was looking at.  "He's just being a good leader, he is just a kid afterall.  Probably no where near any of our experience."

Vin shook his head, "You don't know D as well as I do Red.  He's got it bad for the kid."

Red shook her head, "If you say so, as long as it doesn't affect the hunt, I don't care what Dorian does in his spare time, or who for that matter."

Vin couldn't help but laugh, "Oh you'll care.  You're one of those types, Cool so long as you don't see them holding hands or god forbid kissing."

Red frowned, "And you are so enlightened?"  She laughed.

"Sweetheart, D and I've been friends along time.  I've seen him with a grand told of one man that was worth any thing.  And that man used Dorian.  D never recovered.  He was completely gone for that guy, and when he left with a bunch of things Dorian could care less about he was pretty upset.  So seeing him like this, it's a good thing.  D might losen up a bit.  Kid actually has that going for him.  He says 'look at me' just by being in the room.  Not a hunter I know that does that."  Vin laughed, "It's usually get out of my way, or where is the monster.  But never, 'I'm here.'"

How the kid missed it was beyond him, it was obvious, even Aria knew, she saw, felt it probably too.  He couldn't be that clueless.

**** Aria ****

Dorian walked Nox through the ritual she preformed nearly daily at the drop of a hate.  He'd been right, she'd rushed him through it.  She could see the calming affect it had on Nox and felt horrible about her rush.  She would have to do better next time.  This would help immensely in their overall goal.  Nox could easily surpass her if he could use the technique.

Everyone got off the plane, Nox was looking a million times better as Dorian handed him a beer over his shoulder.  Nox grinned and took the beer with a thanks called back at him.  Aria rolled her eyes, he was milking it now.  He was enjoying Dorian's attention, even if he had no clue what it meant, and from what she could tell he didn't have any clue.  If he did he was hiding it from her, and that alone could speak volumes.  She'd have to ask him at a later date.

There were several cars waiting their arrival as they strode towards their luggage.  Dorian had big black SUVs ready for all their gear in one, and them in another.  Dorian of course didn't drive.  Aria wondered if he eve knew how, but he sat in the passenger seat in front even after Vin had loudly called shot gun.  The look Dorian gave him made Nox laugh, "Boss man says no.  He veto'd that."

Vin had laughed, "I didn't want it anyway, I just wanted to see what he'd do.  He's thrown things at me before.  D gets car sick in the back.  He even rides in front in his Daddy's limo, pisses his father off to no end."

Antoinette laughed, "That would be a sight.  Emilio Vega hissing at Dorian for improper editquite.  Actually that sounds pretty normal from what I hear."

Dorian didn't say anything, he just climbed into the seat and shut the door.  Vin took seat in the very back, Antoinette in the second row, which split up her and Nox.  Nox sat in the front, though he'd probably have been more comfortable in the back.  Aria smiled, he may not realize it, but he was falling into the trap.  Vin leaned over, "You see it too?"

Aria smiled and whispered, "Dangling some pretty impressive bait."

Vin jabbed Aria in the side with his elbow, "Ouch."

He laughed, "Baited Hook, taking the bait, care to wager on the outcome?"

Aria turned and looked at him.  He was deadly serious.  "Not the outcome.  That's pretty obvious."

Vin asked in a quiet whisper, "You think?"

Aria nodded, "He needs this."

Aria could see Vin raise an eyebrow out of the corner of her eye, "Who?"

Aria smiled, "They both do."

Dorian cleared his throat from the front seat, "If the two in the back will listen I'd like to go over the game plan again."

Nox turned around and put a finger to his lips and hissed, "Shhhhh!"

Aria laughed to herself, Aria heard Dorian chuckle up front, "And the class clown has to make his presense known."  Nox's smile brightened, he really did enjoy being noticed that he was trying to steal the attention, it was part of what drove his sister mad.

They went over the plan again.  Nothing really had changed from the events on the plan.  But with Nox actually able to have a full conversation, he was able to elaborate on the land warriors they had in their stash.  It helped that Aria had worked with ex-military supply guy.  She was able to get some through him instead of the usual routes.  These were top of the line black market specials.  And Aria didn't want to know where they came from.  Neither did the Atharim.
