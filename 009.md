**** Vincent ****

The holoscreen the Kid had spun up on the plane had been very beneficial, they had an actual plan of action before hitting the ground running.  They'd not have known to check the warehouse out.  Vin was glad he didn't get stuck with the little song as his back up, she was good in a fight, he was sure of that but he didn't like the idea of only a monster at his back.  Even though he thought of himself as a monster at times too.  Such was life, everyone had their limits.

Dorian sitting next to him on the landing had been rough, but it probably would have been rougher if the kid hadn't gotten it together.  Vin found it odd that the kid didn't know how to do what D walked him through.  Aria had tried to teach him and had failed, it made sense too once Dorian explained it to her.  He used it everyday, a life saving mechanism.  He'd noticed that she didn't walk around completely in that emotionless state as she had when she was younger.  So clearly her control was better, but he still didn't want her at his back being the only one there.  He'd much rather have Red anyway.

When the plane halted Aria insured Nox stayed sitting, and the stewardess were jostled out of the way when Vin got out of the plane.  He shook his body like he'd exerted himself but it was just releasing the tension of the place.  Not everything had been to his liking though it could have been worse.

Red was the first one off after him.  She pulled those fancy sunglasses down over her eyes as she stepped out of the doorway to the plane.  She walked over to him, "So hotel, then to our side of town?"

Vin nodded, "Sure thing Red, but I need a smoke now."  He pulled out his pack and lit a smoke and pulled on it, it had been too long.  He blew a puff of smoke into the wind and it carried over to Red.  She glared at him, it was an accident really, "Oh where you standing there?"  But he couldn't let her know that.

The little song was next followed by the kid, some color had returned to his face and hands.  Dorian was following behind him, putting a cold beer over the kid's shoulder.  Vin laughed to himself, "D's got it bad."

Red turned to see what he was looking at.  "He's just being a good leader, he is just a kid afterall.  Probably no where near any of our experience."

Vin shook his head, "You don't know D as well as I do Red.  He's got it bad for the kid."

Red shook her head, "If you say so, as long as it doesn't affect the hunt, I don't care what Dorian does in his spare time, or who for that matter."

Vin couldn't help but laugh, "Oh you'll care.  You're one of those types, Cool so long as you don't see them holding hands or god forbid kissing."

Red frowned, "And you are so enlightened?"  She laughed.

"Sweetheart, D and I've been friends along time.  I've seen him with a grand told of one man that was worth any thing.  And that man used Dorian.  D never recovered.  He was completely gone for that guy, and when he left with a bunch of things Dorian could care less about he was pretty upset.  So seeing him like this, it's a good thing.  D might losen up a bit.  Kid actually has that going for him.  He says 'look at me' just by being in the room.  Not a hunter I know that does that."  Vin laughed, "It's usually get out of my way, or where is the monster.  But never, 'I'm here.'"

How the kid missed it was beyond him, it was obvious, even Aria knew, she saw, felt it probably too.  He couldn't be that clueless.

**** Aria ****

Dorian walked Nox through the ritual she preformed nearly daily at the drop of a hate.  He'd been right, she'd rushed him through it.  She could see the calming affect it had on Nox and felt horrible about her rush.  She would have to do better next time.  This would help immensely in their overall goal.  Nox could easily surpass her if he could use the technique.

Everyone got off the plane, Nox was looking a million times better as Dorian handed him a beer over his shoulder.  Nox grinned and took the beer with a thanks called back at him.  Aria rolled her eyes, he was milking it now.  He was enjoying Dorian's attention, even if he had no clue what it meant, and from what she could tell he didn't have any clue.  If he did he was hiding it from her, and that alone could speak volumes.  She'd have to ask him at a later date.

There were several cars waiting their arrival as they strode towards their luggage.  Dorian had big black SUVs ready for all their gear in one, and them in another.  Dorian of course didn't drive.  Aria wondered if he eve knew how, but he sat in the passenger seat in front even after Vin had loudly called shot gun.  The look Dorian gave him made Nox laugh, "Boss man says no.  He veto'd that."

Vin had laughed, "I didn't want it anyway, I just wanted to see what he'd do.  He's thrown things at me before.  D gets car sick in the back.  He even rides in front in his Daddy's limo, pisses his father off to no end."

Antoinette laughed, "That would be a sight.  Emilio Vega hissing at Dorian for improper editquite.  Actually that sounds pretty normal from what I hear."

Dorian didn't say anything, he just climbed into the seat and shut the door.  Vin took seat in the very back, Antoinette in the second row, which split up her and Nox.  Nox sat in the front, though he'd probably have been more comfortable in the back.  Aria smiled, he may not realize it, but he was falling into the trap.  Vin leaned over, "You see it too?"

Aria smiled and whispered, "Dangling some pretty impressive bait."

Vin jabbed Aria in the side with his elbow, "Ouch."

He laughed, "Baited Hook, taking the bait, care to wager on the outcome?"

Aria turned and looked at him.  He was deadly serious.  "Not the outcome.  That's pretty obvious."

Vin asked in a quiet whisper, "You think?"

Aria nodded, "He needs this."

Aria could see Vin raise an eyebrow out of the corner of her eye, "Who?"

Aria smiled, "They both do."

Dorian cleared his throat from the front seat, "If the two in the back will listen I'd like to go over the game plan again."

Nox turned around and put a finger to his lips and hissed, "Shhhhh!"

Aria laughed to herself, Aria heard Dorian chuckle up front, "And the class clown has to make his presense known."  Nox's smile brightened, he really did enjoy being noticed that he was trying to steal the attention, it was part of what drove his sister mad.

They went over the plan again.  Nothing really had changed from the events on the plan.  But with Nox actually able to have a full conversation, he was able to elaborate on the land warriors they had in their stash.  It helped that Aria had worked with ex-military supply guy.  She was able to get some through him instead of the usual routes.  These were top of the line black market specials.  And Aria didn't want to know where they came from.  Neither did the Atharim.

**** Antoinette ****

Dorian informed them as they pulled up to the hotel, it wasn't a five star like she had been expecting, but it was at minimum 4 stars and they had the most expensive suite in the joint.  Because Dorian claimed it was better the five of them be close, so the room had a shared common room with four bedrooms off the side.  Dorian hadn't worked out sleeping arangements, which sent Aria and of all people Vin into a fit of giggles and whispered conversation.   However it was Nox who fixed the arrangment issue, "Aria and I can share a room, not that big of deal we do it all the time."

Vin looked at Aria with look that said he didn't beleive a word she said.  She grinned at him, "It's not like that."

Vin nodded, "Sure.  Like hell."

Antoinette was surprised to see Nox waiting impatiently just outside the car door.  Aria moved past him but then she moved, she wasn't quick enough.  The moment Vin stepped out of the SUV Nox had him up against the black vehicle with his hand pressing at his throat.  "I have not slept with Aria.  I will not walk on the toes of other men, nor do I think I will ever have that privledge because of my own damned problems with it.  So I would kindly like you to stop impying otherwise."

Antoinette looked at Aria who was stopped by a single hand on her arm by Dorian.  He was whispering to her, Antoinette couldn't figure out what it was.  He saw her looking at him and smiled before he looked towards the two men.  Vin was in tears near laughing, and Nox's face was scrunched up in anger.  Vin could hardly speak for his laughter, "Your own damned problems?  What you gay?"

Everything happened so fast, Aria pulled free of Dorian and caught the punch that was clearly going to land in Vin's face.  Nox didn't looked stunned, they looked like this had happened before.  Nox was no longer looking at Vin, but at Aria as she pushed the tall lanky kid away from Vin.  Aria spoke in that deadly cold voice of emptiness she used, "Nox will likely have to kill me one day.  Sleeping together, having more than what we already share will make that difficult."  She turned her self around and looked at Vin with a look tha she meant it.  "Lay the fuck off him."

Vin stood up and straightened his collar with a grim grin.  "Whatever you say little song.  Kid ain't worth it anyway.  And for whatever it's worth, sounds like a shit friendship you two have."

Nox took a step forward but he didn't push past Aria.  Antoinette followed Vin, Dorian stayed with the other two, Antoinette was pretty sure that he was trying to assess the situation between the two so-called friends.  Vin was right, knowing you might have to kill a friend was not a good thing to feel.  And rather shitty thing to ask of a friend if you asked her.

Inside Antoinette was surprised by all the white and gold, they were going to get this place dirty, living on the road you became accustomed to crap motels and sleeping on the ground, but not Dorian.  She wondered if he was this soft always, or if he was just playing it up for his new team.  She rarely hunted with him, but she'd heard rumors.  And Vin clearly looked at home as he checked in under Dorian's name, well rather his father's name.  Antoinette began to wonder why Vin even cared about Dorian, it's not like they were even at all alike.  Men were confusing, always had been, probably why she was still single.

Vin handed Antoinette a key and she graciously accepted the key card and followed him to the elevator.  Antoinette laughed, "He's a hot head."

Vin grinned, "I goaded him into it I wanted to see what shit he'd take.  He's in a bad mood today.  I barely got a rise out of him yesterday.  Flying must really be bad."

Antoinette shook his head, "Why do you care?"

Vin looked at her with a frown, "Why don't you?  We have to work with him.  Get to know him a little better, same with the little song.  Dorian probably could use a good second of your time too.  We are here to hunt gods, but if it works you might find you are working with them even more.  This high and mighty act might have worked before, but we need to work as a team, and you aren't being very team like.  I needed to know how far to push Nox before he broke, so I don't do it when it counts.  I'd hate to break him and have him at me when it mattered most.  Or worse yet, he doesn't save my arse because I've been a dick too much.  I guarantee you, when he's in the room, it'll be like nothing ever happened.  He and Aria will have it out under Dorian's watchful eye, just like he and I did.  But I think that she was more worried about me than what I could to do Nox.  They are hiding something."

Antoinette sighed.  "Whatever.  I'll need a drink after this is all said and done, probably several."

Vin laughed, "We all might."
