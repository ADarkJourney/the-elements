**** Vincent ****

Sparring with the little song was always a pleasure, she stopped and had noticed the other two were making out like teenagers, he grinned and smacked her hard with one of the sticks.  She repayed him later for it, doing the same thing.

Vin was surprised when she took a fall, it had been on purpose, but not for what most girls might have done, she had wanted to make it look real, someone was around, and there was one thing he was starting to learn, was that she was good at knowing when people were around, her ability and all that.

He untangled himself from her, he might have thought about getting a feel in but the hunt was on and Vin stalked off in the other direction.  He wished he had more than two sticks as weapons but it would do.  

He walked cautiously through the forest, it was so good to be hunting again.  He saw a figure in the shadows and made towards it.  He stopped when he saw it was a woman waving her hands about like a mad woman, and he heard a crash of water behind him.  A goddess, Vin attempted to sneak up on it but she threw a water ball at him, which disappated before it got to him.  Nox was standing only a few short feet away from him, he thought he saw him wave his hand like he was throwing something.  But clearly he had been mistaken.

A steaming ball of water came flying at him, Nox intercepted, he thought the boy was going to be screaming in pain, but he made a gesture like he was building a wall up, pulling it up from the earth, except there was nothing there.  The motion was so quick Vin thought he had mistaken what had gone on, the boiling water crashed into an invisible wall and Vin could only stare as a ball of fire appeared above Nox's hand and with a quick motion he threw it at the woman in the dead of the night she burst into a thousand flames that Vin could feel at that distance.  It was so hot she burnt to a crisp and as the fire died down there was literally nothing left.

Nox turned to him the gun was lowered and no visible signs he was special Vin blinked.  "Sparkler?"

Nox grinned and a small ball of pure white light appeard in his hand.  Vin readied the sticks in his hand, but Nox dropped his hand and the light disappaited in a shower of sparks.  Vin laughed.  "So that's why litle song laughed at the nick name."

Nox nodded, "Now?"

Vin sighed and stood straight, he hadn't realized he'd been ready to attack him.  "I..."  Vin really didn't know what to say.  "How long?"

Nox took a step closer his hands at his sides, he wasn't threatening, he whispered softly into the night, "A little more than 2 years."

"Little song knows?  D?"  Vin wanted to know everything now, he'd known something was off about the kid.

"Aria knows, I'll tell D soon.  Provided you don't kill me first."  Nox grinned playfully, taking the sting out of the words.  

Vin laughed, "You are safe with me.  You saved my life with your little tricks.  I imagine it's why the little song keeps you around.  You save her too?"

Nox laughed, "No.  She saved my bacon.  She keeps me around to kill her if she goes bad."  He was still grinning but Vin knew that he wasn't joking.  He could see the fear in his eyes.  One day this kid knew he was going to have to kill his best friend, and their entire relationship made sense.

Vin looked up and saw Dorian and Aria coming their way he nodded towards them, "We've company."

Nox nodded, "Yeah I heard them.  I'll tell you about sometime."
