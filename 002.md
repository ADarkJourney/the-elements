Dorian left them with Nox laughing.  He'd gone to presumably change into an outfit that was more hunter like.  It would be Nox who noticed that Dorian was wearing fine silk and expensive clothes.  Aria didn't care as long as it functioned. 

But they both hopped the metro back to the warehouse and got their things together.  Not that she needed much, her wallet was with her, and she never left with out her sword and a gun.  The black leather trench coat it it from view as it was intended to do.  Nox on the other hand had issues, he was always armed.  But with Dorian on watch he'd have to resort to passive uses of his ability.  There would be no flaming whips or bolts of lighting coming from Nox today.  And such a shame, it was so much easier to take down a god with the power of another god.  

Nox took the steps two at a time up to his make shift armory.  Aria stood in the door way of the room that was no unlocked, and watched as he pulled out his crossbow and bolts.  He sighed at the weight of the crossbow, he wasn't going to be able to hid it.  He also had a gun he hid at the small of his back, with an extra magazine in his coat pocket.

Aria knew that Nox was debating which else he might use.  She could feel his feelings about close range weapons, he didn't like to get up close and personal.  It left scars.  Aria chuckled and Nox turned to look at her with a playful grin.  "Get out of my head."

Aria smiled at him.  "But it's always so interesting."

He walked past her and ruffled her hair.  Aria rolled her eyes.  "I'm not a child."

Aria saw him grinning as he headed down the stairs.  "I know.  But it's so much fun."

Aria shook her head at him and smiled.  He was in a plaful mood, hopefully it would stay that way as they headed into the underground.  It was hard to fall into the darkness when Nox was radiating a good mood.

Aria had followed him to the armory and back down stairs to the kitchen.  He grabbed two bottles of water from the fridge and tossed one to her.  "So we are really going to do this.  Kill a man because he can heal the masses?"

He saw the shadowed look that passed over through her eyes.  She didn't have to answer, he knew what it meant.  "Yeah, I know.  It's a matter of our life, or his life.  The greater good."  He sighed.  "Kill one here, to save another there.  But doesn't mean I have to like it."

Aria put a hand on his arm and squeezed.  "Neither do I, but we do what we must to survive.  It's either that or Borovsky hangs us as traitors."

Nox laughed.  "Traitor, you mean monsters.  Aria, because that's all we are to men like Borovsky and Dorian Vega."

Aria grinned.  "I don't think Dorian is much like Borovsky no matter their friendship.  He seemed more put off by the fact that the Regus and Borovsky were sending me to my death with my mission to kill Ascendancy.  And while he still thought of me as a tool to be used, I think there was more to it than that.  But I can't read thoughts, only emotions."

Nox nodded, "We'll have to keep an eye on him.  It's a good thing you are doing the job, cause I don't think I could cut a man down in cold blood like that."

Aria frowned, "But it could be more dangerous this way."

Nox frowned as well.  "I know but I'll pull you out.  Lucas will remind you later what it means to live.  We'll deal with it as it comes."  Nox finished the bottle of water and threw it away.  "Let's get going, we don't want to keep Master Vega waiting."

Aria laughed.  Nox gave her a questioning look before she added, "He told me to call him Master instead of Mr. Vega."

Nox grinned.  "He's a character for sure."

Aria nodded, "Reminds me of someone I know."

Nox stuck his tongue at her and pushed her towards the door.  "Let's go."
