It was definately a sight to see, Dorian's reaction to Nox and his father.  For everything the Emilio Vega was he was a strong man, and Sparkler didn't back down.  He was much stronger than Dorian, and everyone else he'd seen go head to head with Mr.  Vega, and that included Martin.  Maybe it was because Nox was so much younger, or maybe it had to do with something else entirely.  Dorian had been taken aback by it all but he seemd in relatively good spirits despite the fact that his so-called boyfriend called his father a pompous ass.  The boy had style for  man with a pedigree no greater than that of a cocker spaniel.  Vin had nearly laughed at the comment from the senior Vega, but the beautiful and every present matriarch of the Vega house presented herself in full regalia and Vin was highly impressed with vision of her.

Dorian kissed Nox softly before he removed his arms from the other man.  It was almost too hard to watch as Dorian kissed his wife on the cheek and offered her an arm.  Vin watched as the entire demeanor of the couple changed.  Mr Vega commented, "My dear Ana, does the presence of the boy make you uncomfortable?"

Anastasia looked at Mr. Vega, "Sir, Mr. Durante is not making me uncomfortable.  You are.  My husband and I have guests to greet, if it pleases you."  She offered him to lead the way to which Mr. Vega followed.  

Sparkler visibly relaxed.  "You okay, kid?"

Nox grinned at Vin, "Didn't think that would bother me."

Aria followed Mr. Vega back with a glance back and Nox, Sparkler nodded and she followed.  

Vin laughed, "She's leaving you with me?"

Nox walked over to the bar and pour a small amount of vodka and drank it quickly.  "No, not leaving me with you, she was making sure I was okay.  And I'm okay.  Though I didn't expect to be the jealous type."  He grinned, "Shall we?  We've a fancy party to attend, one to which we must be on our best behavior.  Which means it will be a boring party."

Vin laughed.  "Damn straight, Sparkler.  We might have to disobey just a little."

Outside the study Cruz was waiting a few doors down he smiled at them, Vin was sure it was more to greet Nox.  Cruz noted, "That looks good on you.  Dad, chose well."  

Nox grinned, "I'm sure anything would have looked fine on me, I am me after all."

Vin laughed with Cruz, it was going to be a very interesting night.  

Dorian and Ana were standing near the door greeting guests, Cruz tugged them both into the high arched double doors that lead into what Vin had to consider was the ball room.  A ball room, in Dorian's house.  Damn the man was rich.  It had high vaulted ceilings and chandeliers hanging from that gave off a very elegant lighting affect.  The tables were lines with white linen table clothes, the floor in the middle was left open in front of the what Vin could only call a small orchestra that was playing some song or another.  Cruz ushered Vin and Nox to a table where the little song already sat.  She looked bored.  "You guys are sitting with me and Cousin Adell.  We call it the kids table.  Though you two aren't kids by any starndards, and neither are we.  But it's where we always get stuck, by the door, and the draft from outside wafting in.  Can't bother the guests with that now can we."

Vin laughed, "I see how we rate."

Cruz took a seat by Aria and started engaging with her, telling her she looked lovely, and asking about his mother.  Vin grinned and took the other seat next to Aria, Sparkler smiled and shrugged and sat down next to Cruz, the final seat was for Adell he could only assume.

Guests filed in and eventually the double doors closed and Mr. Vega took the stage in front of the orchestra.  He tapped the mic and it echoed into the large room.  "Welcome to out family, friends and honored guests.  As usual, all proceeds of today's even go to those who require medical assistance in our great country.  My son and his wife have donated the use of the estate and it's surrounding gardens for your you evening pleasure.  We will as always have the finest quisine available in Madrid.  I'm sure you will not be disappointed.  I am honored to have a new benefactor present, Jörg Gottschalk, he has made a highly unsual generous donation to our wonderful cause.  I will see to it personally, that these funds are well utilized in the cause, as well as I do with all of your very generous donations.  I will hand you over to the orchestra for your musical and dancing pleasure.  Please make every use of our hospitality, it is our honor to host such generous people."

Vin nearly laughed, but he didn't, the girl next to him and Nox was quiet.  Aria was scanning the room casually taking everything, Nox was laid back sipping at a fluted glass of champaign which he promptly put down.

Vin saw Dorian and his wife sitting at a table with his father and two women and their glorious high priced benefactor, the two women could only be Dorian's mother and grandmother.  The dance floor was empty, the music was not very dance worthy, a classic waltz Vin guessed.

It surprised Vin to see Nox walk up to the table the Vega's were sitting at, he had thought that he was not going to show any affection but short of a grin to Dorian before he stood next to the eldest Vega matriarch and extended his hand.  Vin had to give the boy credit.  He went high with is first dance, there was not an ounce of timid in Sparkler.

Vin wished he could hear the conversation, it appeared that Mrs. Vega was declining the invitation with tenacity, but Nox was grinning madly, and with a blushing elderly woman, Sparkler walked out into the middle of the floor.  Every eye turned to them, and Nox had only eyes for his partner who was blushing bright red by the time she started to dance.

Slowly the dance floor gained a few more dancers, Cruz spoke under the music, "He really is something else.  Grandmother never dances."

Aria grinned, "Nox is stubborn and charming."

Vin stole a glance at Dorian's table, Mr. Vega and the patron were speaking but everyone else was watching Nox and Cruz's great grandmother dance.  Dorian looked a little peakid.

**** Dorian ****

A man on the guestlist showed up bearing a multi-million dollar donation to the Vega Foundation with apologies, his father of course accepted him with open arms.  That kind of money was hard pressed not to be taken seriously.  Christian ran the bank information and sure enough it was a legit account.  His father gave him a seat at their table.  One that was usually reserved for his late grandfather, but it seemed money mattered today, and Dorian couldn't fault his father for it.

Jörg Gottschalk was also an Atharim supporter, he'd been robbed once by Vin.  Coincidences were rare in their line of work.  Dorian was going to have to keep an eye on him.

After his father returned to the table and the music started playing Nox casually walked up and grinned at Dorian before he turned his attentions on Dorian's grandmother.  

Nox spoke over the music and the caphony of the ballroom, "Mrs. Vega, may I have the honor of the first dance?"

Grandmother Vega blushed ata being asked by a random cute man.  "My boy, I'm old enough to be your Great Great Grandmother."

Nox grinned, "Ma'am, you don't look a day over 40.  It would be my honor to have the first dance with the matriarch of the Vega throne."

Dorian ran his fingers over his mustache hiding the smile and the laughter behind his hand.  His grandmother shook her head, "I haven't danced since my husband passed, maybe you should dance with My dear Ana."

Nox smiled and bowed slightly to Ana, "Mrs. Vega, I will dance with Ms. Ana, but you are matriarch and should be first.  I promise I won't make a fool of you, we can even use the walker if you are worried about falling, but I'm certain I will not let you fall."

Dorian laughed, "Grandmother, he's as tenatious as you are."

She looked over at Dorian with an exhasperated look and saw Dorian's smile and turned back to Nox with a wry smile, "Boy if you let me fall you will not hear the end of it."

Nox offered her a hand up and his arm afterwards.  Dorian smiled as Nox walked out to the center floor with his grandmother on his arm like it was nothing more than a first dance.  Dorian glanced over at Aria who was smiling while she watched Nox, she saw him looking at her and Dorian tilted his head.  Her smile widened.  Dorian shook his head, this was probably a far bigger mistake than letting Nox meet his father.

Nox was waltzing with his grandmother, he held her up and she looked like she was having a good time.  They were chatting, and Dorian wished he could hear what they said.  But Ana put her hand on his arm and leaned in and whispered in his ear closely, as lovers would, "He is something else, my sweet.  He has every eye on him here."

Dorian smiled and turned to whisper back, "He'll steal the show I'm sure.  Actually I rather count on it."

Ana gasped, "Dorian, what do you have planned?"

Dorian grinned at his wife.  "You shall see."

The music ended and everyone left the floor and Nox brought his grandmother back with a smile so big Dorian was sure his grandmother had not had such a good time in her life.  Nox came around the table and Dorian stopped him, "I didn't know you could dance."  

Nox grinned, "You never asked."  He looked out at the dance floor, "Is it always so dead?"

Dorian laughed, "There is not enough drink in folks yet."

Nox waved it off like it was nothing.  He walked past Dorian and stopped at his mother.  Ana almost looked apalled.  Dorian whispered, "I think he's going down the line of matriarchs, you should be next."

Ana smiled and spoke so Nox could hear, "So long as I'm next.  He is a fine catch for any who can reel him in."  Dorian's father chuckled but said nothing. 

Nox grinned widely as he offered Dolores Vega his hand, "May I have this dance, Mrs. Vega."

Dorian's mother stood with out prompting and without a word and took Nox's arm and he escorted his mother out to the floor and they danced.  

Dorian's father leaned back in his chair and whispered to Dorian, "Is he going to dance with every female in the place to spite me?"

Dorian laughed, "Father,"  he nodded towards Nox, "That is Nox.  He has been and always will be a ladies man."  Emilio gave Dorian a frown, "I will tell you about it at a later date."  His father nodded and turned his attention back to their guest of honor.

Mr. Gottschalk turned to Dorian, "Your friend, he works with you?  What does he do exactly?"

Dorian smiled, "Mr. Gottschalk, Mr. Durante is a consultant my father has hired to figure out some bizarre phenomenon's resulting in one of our plants.  He and his friends are in town, and I offered my estate as a home base for their inquiries."

Mr. Gottschalk nodded, "He seems quite at ease on the dance floor.  Even if no one else has take up dancing yet."

Dorian smiled, "I do beleive that Mr. Durante likes the attention.  I can't say as much for my mother."

Their guest turned to Ana, "Ms. Vega, and you wish to subject yourself to his attention seeking."

Dorian watched Ana closely, "Mr.Gottschalk, may I call you Jorg?"  He nodded, "Well Jorg, Mr. Durante is a close family friend, amongst a consultate for my Father in law, and I would be honored to be able to provide entertainment for our many guests."

Dorian laughed, "Your wish may be granted sooner rather than later."  

The song ended and Nox escorted his mother to her seat with a flourished bow.  "It has been my pleasure, Mrs. Vega."

Nox turned to Ana and she stood up without being asked.  Dorian smiled and Nox grinened, "As my lady wishes."

He took her out on the dance floor, they took a waltzing form and then the music abruptly changed, Ana turned her attention on Dorian and Dorian couldn't help but smile his wife started to walk towards him with fire in her eyes, but Nox grabbed her hand just as the tango's classic call sounded and she spun into his arms with a look that said exactly what Dorian thought.  _Oh my god, he can tango too._

The music coursed on and Anastasia looked at him for a beat or two before she obliged him and he carried her across the floor like he'd been doing it for years.  He lead and she followed and there was not a face at the tables that was not trained on Nox and Ana.

Dorian tried very hard not to show too much interest, but thankfully it was his wife out there as well.  Drooling over her was far more acceptable.  And she moved with the grace he knew she possessed.  But it was Nox he watched.  It had always amazed Dorian how even Aria walked like a deadly wolf, Vin was the same, and nearly every hunter, except for Nox walked with a preadtory gate, it was part of being on the guard all the time, he knew he probably did too, but Nox, he didn't, and Dorian finally understood.  Everything was a lure to attracted the right kind of attention, he walked like a dancer, grace but not deadly.  Dorian smiled and watched his wife and the man he was hoping for more with dance, he was lost in that moment.  

By the time they were finished they were both breathless as was Dorian.  Nox brought Ana back to her seat, she was flushed from the exherstion as well as dancing with Nox in such an intimate way.  She leaned over and whispered in Dorian's ear, "If you don't keep him, I will."

Dorian grinned, and caught Nox's arm and stood up and whispered, "You surprise me at every turn.  I'm going to smile now like I said something threatening to you about dancing with me wife like that, play the game?" 

Dorian let go of Nox's arm and Nox just grinned back at him and winked and walked away.  Mr. Gottschalk was the first to respond, "It seems you have to try a little harder Mr. Vega to keep your wife happy."

Dorian laughed, "I've got it handled, don't you worry."
