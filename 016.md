**** Nox ****

Nox hadn't remembered falling asleep.  He remembered kissing Dorian and being drowsy from everything that had happened, but falling asleep he had no recollection.   Dorian's arm was drapped over his chest and his partially clothed body was pressed up against Nox's at what had to be an awkward angle.  The morning light seeped through the window, he wondered what time it was.  And why he was still sleeping, it was rare the sun was up before him.  

Nox watched Dorian sleep for a while, a small smile turned on the other man's lips and Nox pressed a kissed lightly too it, "Morning," Nox whispered.

Dorian opened his eyes, "Well, I take it as a good sign you are still in my bed in the morning."

Nox grinned playfully at him, "A first for me."  He leaned over and kissed Dorian, "And hopefully more to come."

Dorian smiled and rolled over on top of Nox pinning him, Nox swallowed as he felt the man's weight on top of him.  It wasn't fear that coursed through his body, aprehension, angst.  He wanted more, his body reacted but Nox was not sure.  Dorian smiled and kissed Nox's neck up his ear and nibbled at his ear, "Easy.  Nothing more, I promise."  Nox relaxed a little, and Dorian smiled against his neck, "If it's too much, tell me."

Nox nodded, his voice failing him as Dorian kissed and nipped at his neck.  Dorian smiled each time he reacted and continued the onslaught.  Dorian pulled up on his elbows and looked down at Nox with a smile that said Dorian was completely enjoying himself, "I love that you react to me.  I know it's hard for you to let go."  Dorian leaned his head against Nox's forehead and smiled, "We'll get there.  There is no rush."

Nox lifted his head and kissed Dorian. There were no words for it.  Unfortunately it left both of them slightly fustrated for all the implied movements, the deeds that did not happen.  Dorian rolled off to the side and sat up and grabbed a towel from the nightstand, "Grab a shower.  We have some work to do."

Nox grinned and sat up and crawled over behind Dorian and wrapped his arms around him, "You are too patient, thank you."  Nox kissed Dorian's neck.  

Dorian gave Nox an appreciative moan and grabbed the towel and tossed it into his face, "Shower, cariño, or you'll drive me even more crazy."

Nox grinned and sat next to Dorian as he scooted off the bed and stood before him, "What's cariño mean?"  Nox knew he probably butchered the Spanish, he'd get better.  

Dorian smiled, "Just a term of endearment.  Like honey or darling."

Nox smiled happily, "I can live with that.  Thank you D, for understanding."

Dorian nodded and stood up and playfully shoved Nox in the direction of the bathroom, "Anything for you.  Now. Shower."

Nox laughed, "Alright, alright.  I'm going."  He grinned playfully, "Pushy much?"  Before Dorian could get another word in Nox shut the bathroom door.  Nox's heart was pounding in his chest, his pants were tight and he knew why Dorian wanted him to go away, he needed as much down time as Nox did right that moment.  Cold shower? or...

Nox finally looked at the bathroom and was not overly surprised to see marble tiles and countertops with a double shower with glass doors that weren't those cheeze speckled kinds, full view of everything inside.  Nox sighed, there was alot more than just the intimate parts he was going to have to get used to if he was going to date Dorian... date... such a foreign and childish word.

Nox undressed and got into the shower and turned on the water, it was cold at first and perfect for other issues, but it warmed slowly and Nox grabbed the shampoo bottle and smelled the distinct scent of Dorian in it.  He thought, well why not?

Ten minutes later Nox was toweling off and walking out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist, he looked up from drying his hair and didn't see Dorian, but there was a note on the bed.  Nox grabbed his bag of things before he picked up the note, dropping the bag in it's place.  In Dorian's neat handwriting, "Showering down the hall, use whatever you need. - D"

Nox smiled and folded the letter and put it carefully in the side panel of his bag and got dressed.  As he was dressing he noticed a crumpled up bag folded neatly in the other side pocket.  Nox grabbed it after button his jeans.  Nox couldn't say the name on the bag, but it smelled like the lavender and other things Lillian had said she was refilling.  Nox smiled, but he couldn't read the ingredients, Aria would be able to help he hoped.  He didn't want to have to ask Dorian.  Nox tucked the bag back in the side pocket and grabbed a blue t-shirt and started to pull it over his head as he walked out the door.  Barefoot, Nox padded his way downstairs to find coffee!

**** Dorian ****

It was hard to say who had fallen asleep first but Nox was definitely the first one to wake up.  Dorian was pleasantly surprised he'd not left in the middle of the night.  And he was more than happy to show Nox exactly how happy he was. It wasn't more than the night before only more sudden, but a step in the right direction.  Dorian could wait for Nox to be ready, though he knew he was going to pay for it later, but a shower alone would do them both good.  

Nox finally joked his way into the bathroom and Dorian grabbed a clean towel and clothes, he chose hunting gear over casual home attire, they'd probably be out digging ditches as they say.  And it was far more practical, and wouldn't make Nox too uncomfortable.

When Dorian returned to his bedroom, Nox was already gone, his bag on the bed, and the note missing.  Dorian smiled and wondered where he'd gotten off to.  Dorian went downstairs, the kitchen or the gym would be the most likely place.  He remembered the past few mornings he'd spent in Nox's company, coffee was a prerequisit so kitchen it was.

Dorian found Nox sitting on a kitchen stool sipping at a steaming cop of coffee flirting with the cook and her help.  Dorian leaned in the doorway and cleared his throat, the women jumped, Nox turned casually to look at him with a twinkle in his eye and a grin on his face.  "They were regaling me of tales of Dorian Vega as a boy."

Dorian pushed away from the wall and stood behind Nox and wrapped his hands and leaned agaisnt Nox's back and draped a hand over his shoulder and looked at the cook, "Have they been now?"  It was playful but the women paled and blushed all at the same time.  

Nox laughed at their reactions. "I take it they aren't used to you showing affection to your .... "  

Nox apparently didn't know how to finish the sentence any better than he did, "We will figure that out someday.  Boyfriend just seems so childish."

Nox looked up at him with a playful grin, "And other words that come to mind aren't exactly accurate yet."

Dorian laughed and kissed Nox along his neck, "I beg to differ, those words apply."  Dorian whispered in his ear, "Even if we've not fully accomplished the end result.  You are my lover, Nox.  I have no other."

Nox swallowed hard at Dorian's words and reached around and put his hand behind Dorian's neck and pulled him into kiss.  It was highly awkward angle, but it was far more enjoyable because Nox had initiated in front of women he'd been flirting with prior.  Dorian was taking pride in all the things he was getting from Nox.  Things that even Dorian had trouble with.  There was one thing about being with Nox, he was not shy in public, the face of strength and confidence he could do well, even when he felt shy and nervous.  Dorian was pretty sure he prefered the shy nervous Nox over the loud confident one, at least when it came to their private life, something only he got to see.  That made Dorian proud.

Vin cleared his throat, "Get a room!"

Nox laughed agaisnt Dorian's lips and Dorian pulled away.  Nox grinned, "We just left our room for coffee!"

Nox pulled the second cup on the table up and handed it to Dorian, someone had poured it while they were kissing.  The women were off doing their own thing now, but their red ears gave away just how uncomfortable they had been watching them.

Aria padded into the room carrying a banana and nibbling at it she smiled as she saw Dorian with his arm wrapped around Nox.  She didn't say anything as she walked past them into the dinning room, "Food out here."

Nox turned to look and stood up and pressed himself agaisnt Dorian with a grin, "I'm hungry."

Dorian blushed, the way he said it, the look in his eyes said so much more than Nox's words, and Nox knew it.  Dorian leaned in to whisper, "You want to kill me don't you?"

Nox kissed Dorian's neck, "No, but I don't want you to stop trying either, cariño"  Nox pulled away and kissed Dorian softly on the lips before he hookd his arm in Dorian's and they walked into the dinning room together, as a couple.
