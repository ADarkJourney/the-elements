**** Aria ****

Aria woke up while it was still dark.  Nox had apparently not gone to bed, he was a constant dull echo in her head, which in itself was good, she hadn't had any nightmares.  She woke to voices in the other room and her wallet missing.

Aria got up and took a shower and got into clean clothes, eventually everything would need to be washed.  She was wearing her favorite shirt, two stick figures one saying "Don't Worry, I got your back!" while holding the other's back - literally.  It made her smile, and it was the only shirt she owned with a saying.  

Aria left her weapons where they'd spent the night and walked out to the other room to find food, Vin and Nox chatting away about something.  Nox was the first to look up and he grinned as he read her shirt, "I love that shirt."

Vin looked over and smiled, "So very much not the little song.  But I like it."

Nox laughed, "Oh it's her, you just don't know her well enough.  I got breakfast this morning.  I beat you too it."

Aria frowned, "But you didn't sleep any Nox."

He got up and poured another cup of coffee, "I'm good, I got coffee."  Aria shook her head and made a plate.

"What ya'll got going here?"  She sat down in front of the holo screens and saw that the rendering was complete, and still searching databases.  "How long has it been going?"

Nox shrugged, "Since you went to bed I suppose.  He must be hard to find."

Aria felt Dorian wake up with a headache, "Dorian needs some OJ I think, did you think to get some?"

Nox nodded and poured a cup and a cup of coffee, "Yeah I knew he'd be feeling it this morning."

Dorian staggered out with his hand to his head in just his jeans, "Damn!  But you guys are loud and the coffee smells good."  Aria saw Nox watching Dorian, she wasn't sure what he was feeling as he had grabbed the power and hid from her, he was being protective of his emotions this morning.

Vin was watching them too, Aria could feel him holding back his comments.  She wondered what Vin and Nox had talked about.

Nox pointed to the cups sitting on the table, "You probably want both of those."

Dorian smiled and took the coffee mug in his hands and smiled, "Thanks."  He drank nearly the whole thing before he fixed a plate and sat down next to Aria and looked at the image on the holos.  He frowned, "I know him."

He had everyone's attention, and he smiled as he made them wait.  He took a bite of bacon and several swallows of orange juice before he continued on.  He was as bad as Nox, Aria thought.  "He works for my father.  I don't know what he does..."  Dorian paused as Nox stopped the search and changed a few parameters around on the holo screen, and three seconds later the image of Mat√≠as Villegas popped up on another holo screen with everything they ever wanted to know about him.  Dorian smiled, "Damn!  You know what you are doing on that."

Nox shrugged, "Only narrowed the search is all.  Nothing overly complicated."

Aria laughed, "Yeah, and he's no hero either."  Nox stuck his tongue out her but the others just staired at them like they were crazy.  Aria wasn't going to explain, they'd find out soon enough.  She asked the next obvious question, "So do we go after him, and hope he's with our weather goddess since they are obviously working together?  Or do we stay here and look for her?"

Nox flipped through a few more screens and smiled, "We go for him.  He went back home to Spain it seems."  On the screen was him and their air goddess on a security camera at an airport entering a gate for Madrid.  Nox sighed and Aria could feel the terror building inside, he knew what that meant.

But Dorian grinned, "How about a road trip?"  He rolled his eyes, "I'll survive a few nights on the ground or cheap motel if I have to.  But I don't think Nox will survive another plane ride."

Nox relaxed visibly, "Are you sure?"

Dorian nodded, "Yeah.  I'll be fine, promise."  He smiled.

Nox laughed, "Ain't you a doll?"  

Dorian, "I suppose I should let Anastasia know we are coming, and to expect guests.  I don't want to get yelled out."  He got up with a sigh.  "Leave before checkout, and use the rentals.  I'll have to call about that."  

Vin laughed, "I can do that, you call the wifey and I'll handly the SUVs.  I think I can pretend to be Mr. Vega."


It seemed they had a plan of action now.  Aria supposed that was a good thing, they were going to Madrid, she hadn't been there before.
