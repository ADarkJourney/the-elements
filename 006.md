**** Dorian ****

Dorian found himself drapped with a blanket on the couch where he'd fallen asleep in a pair of young Atharim's living arrangement.  He felt wildly out of place.  He glanced at his wallet and saw that he had a few messages from Martin, and that it was 4am.  He found he had to releive himself and he had no idea where to go.

He got up from the couch which was surprisingly comfortable, no wonder he'd fallen asleep.  Dorian wandered around the back where he thought he saw someone moving, at 4am?  Dorian was surprised to see Aria moving fluidly through motions of a kata.  He didn't recognize it, but then again there were probably millions of forms and he'd not recognize them all.  Aria smiled at him.

He whispered loudly so she could hear from the distance, "Facilities?"

Aria stopped what she was doing and walked towards him.  He could see her forehead was slick with sweat, how long had she been up?  

She walked into a room next to the stairs that lead up. "You can use mine."  

She flipped on the light and Dorian blinked at the large Toaist painting on the wall.  It spoke of serenity and he stared out it in awe.  "Wow."

She smiled.  "Through that door.  I know, impressive isn't it?  Lucas painted it."

Dorian whistled softly, "I'd like to meet him someday.  Damn good artist."

Aria laughed, "He prefers to work on human skin.  This was done special."

Dorian nodded and understood.  "He did your's I take it."

Aria nodded, "Re-inked it yes, he did Nox's completely.  He's good at what he does."

"I can imagine."  Dorian was impressed.  "Mind if I grab a shower."  He felt the grime of the bar still on him.  He hated that feeling and surprised he'd lasted this long with it on his skin.

Aria nodded, "Yeah sure.  I'll grab a clean shirt from Nox's, it should fit.  And he'll never notice it's missing as long as it's not got one of his stupid sayings on it."

Dorian laughed, "Thanks."  Though it wasn't exactly what was on his mind at the time.  He really had to kick this kid out of his head.  

Aria's bathroom was just as elegant as her room.  The blue and cream times made it serene.  The tub was absolutely gorgeous.  He was still checking out the detail of the tile work on the walls when Aria set a towel and one of Nox's shirts on the sink.  "That's Nox's handywork.  I'm sure he didn't paint it, but he did the tile work, and chose the colors."

Dorian looked confused, "You didn't do any of the design work?  How strange for a girl."

Aria laughed.  "It was a surprise, and if I had any say in the matter it would probably be pretty drab.  You shoulda seen my last apartment."  She turned and left closing the door behind her.  He was left alone in complete silence.  He couldn't hear anything except the echo of his own feet on the floor and he almost thought he could hear his own heartbeat.

Dorian took a look at his wallet and read the messages from Martin.  The first was just notification that he'd sent the files on the mission to his email.  The second however was most interesting, it was sent over a series of messages.  "I do have a favor to ask.  There is an American who has recently come across to us.  She is reputable.  Take her with you, assess her and give me a report.  I will warn you, she does't appear to work in teams well."

Dorian sighed as he looked at the name on the file he'd sent him.  Jacinda Cross.  He'd heard the name.  One of the oldest hunters alive because of her cold hard demeanor and her knack for getting the job done no matter what.  But American reports were not like their European counterparts.  The American's were lack luster in organization.  Hardly a challenege most of the time.  But he'd do what he was asked.

He had contact information for her.   Dorian sent her a text.  "God Hunting - Meet me at HQ @ 8am - DV"  And he sent along with that directions to the little room Aria used for her research.  It was the safest place to meet he thought.  

He also sent a message to two people he'd worked with before.  To meet him at the same place at the same time.  Antoinette Cailot, had worked with Aria before, and he liked her no-nonsense attitude.  She was pratical in application.  And her field work was explemorary.  The last party member was Vincent Auclair, a man of ill repute, he would be able to get into places they needed to get into with ease.  Dorian liked working with him despite his need to have control of everything.

Dorian got his shower in and he felt 100% better.  He looked at Nox's shirt sitting atop the sink and sighed, he pulled it over, the red shirt was slightly faded, but it fit well.  It was probably lose on Nox, his frame was much smaller than Dorian's.  And it smelled like him.  He was not soon going to forget the gnawing feeling in his gut about him. 

Dorian found Nox in the kitchen making a pot of coffee.  Nox smirked, then yelled.  "Aria!  Why didn't you wake me up when you took the shirt from my room?"

Dorian heard her laugh from the dojo.  But she didn't say anything to his comment.  "You mind?"  

Nox shook his head.  "Nah, just messing with Aria."

"Since you are all up, mind meeting at HQ for a quick meet and greet of the team, we'll meet back here for full briefing and planning.  Your sister won't mind?"  Dorian didn't want to make matters worse for the blonde he'd briefly met.

Nox shook his head.  "Aurora left a note, said she won't be back for a while.  We'll order food and can make a night of it."

Dorian nodded, "8am, Aria's little office.  See you there."

And with that Dorian headed for the metro.  He was sure he was making a mistake with something but right now he didn't care.

**** Antoinette ****

The Convocation from the Regus had brought Antoinette to Moscow.  She had missed the meeting itself, as she was too far away, but she'd watched the recording and it still sent shivers down her spine.  She was glad not to be there when they killed the traitor, but she would have liked to felt the vibe in the room whe the Regus announced the Archangels.  She didn't think she had a shot in hell in joining.  

Sure she was good at her job, but she wasn't a Martin Borovsky, or even Dorian Vega.  Some thought Dorian was just Martin's lackey, someone who only got recognition because Martin acknowledged him as a friend.  What most of those hunters didn't know was that Dorian did it all on his own.  His money bought him nothing.  His reputation was well earned, but he always played it off as if he were Martin's lackey.  He liked it that way.  But Antoinette knew better, she'd worked with Dorian without Borovsky there.  And he was good in his own right.

So it was highly surprising when she got a text message from Dorian stating that she was to meet him at 8am to go god hunting.  It was a dream come true.  

8am was closer at hand than she liked, thankfully the hotel she was staying in wasn't too far away from the Enlightened district.  She'd chosen it for that purpose alone.  Antoinette pulled her red hair back in a pony tail and threw on her fur lined coat and a pair of dark sun glasses and headed out the door.  Her gear she'd leave hidden in the closet with a lock on it of course.  Guns and such weren't there for the maids to play with, but she wasn't in need of carrying her gear whereve she went.  Headquarters was safe enough.  But she always carried a small gun in her pocket book anyway, just in case.  

Moscow's headquarters had nothing on the Vatican, though the security was slightly better, but who was going to break into the lower levels of the Vatican anyway.  Any theif who tried ended up working for them, or was strung up on some cross somewhere as an example.  That was just a rumor anyway, there were a lot of rumors like that.  Once such rumor was that Aria Piccolo was Sentient.  Though Antoinette had heard the truth of that matter from Martin Borovsky himself.  She could hardly beleive that the girl she'd helped train was a monster, but it did explain a lot about the girl.  Rumor also had it she was an up and coming hunter, someone to keep an eye on.  Now that she was out of Father Dimitri's care, she was thriving.  Good for her, though the rumor now fact made Antoinette question a lot of what she had come to beleive of the girls abilities.  Doubt in your fellow hunters would be your down fall.  But chances of working with her again where slim, Aria was still overly sensative to people, no amount of knowledge was going to fix that.

Antoinette was the first to arrive at the desired location, 10 minutes early, she noticed all the paper clippings on the wall and started to try to decifer some of the bits and bobs while she waited.  She saw Martin Borovsky's neat hand on some of the notes, and one that she recognized very much.  Aria's perfect scrawl was etched into more notes on the wall than she could count.  What was she working on and why was she in this office?  Dorian what are you getting me into, was the last thought Antoinette had before the door opened behind her.

**** Vincent ****

Two weeks plus gone since the convocation.  It had been a glorious day.  The Regus was inspiring.  It had been 10 years since he'd been sprung from jail by Martin Borovsky.  The man was a miracle worker!  And the Regus a man of honor.  Vincent knew that his skills were needed when hunting gods, he'd been on every mission with Martin before he was taken away by higher demands.   Dorian was his man now.  He worked with him nearly at every turn.  They'd been in Moscow for the convocation of course.  But they stayed at Martin's request.  He had Dorian on some hush hush mission, that took the brillian man only a day to do.  

When Vin got the message at 5 am to come see him and meet the new team he was ready to go.  He arrived early, he always arrived early.  He had been sitting outside the room they were designated to meet watching everyone go by it.  Until one red head opened the door, walked inside and shut herself in.  He smiled to himself.  He knew her.  He'd worked with her a time or two.  Vin was horrible with names, women in particular.  It always got him in trouble.  It wasn't that they all looked alike, cause man he had so many images of the women in his head.  This red head, that one.  He sighed at the thoughts, each one had been naked in his head of course.  

But this red head he'd not slept with, she was a hunter, Vin tried hard not to mix business with pleasure, but sometimes exceptions had to be made.  

Vin got up and followed Red into the office.  He opened the door and found it was pretty barren except for the computer on the desk, and paper and string plastering the wall.  He took a step inside and wondered what was going on.  "Red."

The woman turned around and lowered her sunglasses to look over the tops.  She smiled brightly, the white of her teeth stark against the bright red lipstick she wore.  Kissable lips.  He smiled back as she greeted him with a kiss on each cheek.  "Vin.  Dorian called you too?  Any idea what this all is?"

Vin shook his head.  "No idea Red.  D always has a plan though.  I'm sure he won't let us down."  Really he didn't care what this all was, until Dorian told him the objective and was getting paid for the work he wasn't going to think about it.  Vin sat down in the chair and put his feet up on the desk.  "I wonder who else D called in.  If he's calling it in, Martin's not here.  D's stepping on up in the world."  That was a good thing, that meant he would too, it was a matter of riding the right coat tails.

Now all Vincent had to do was wait for their illustrious leader to make headway and they'd be set.  Gods to hunt, so much fun!  They were such a challenge.  Bring it on thought Vin, Bring. It. On!
