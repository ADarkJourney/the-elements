**** Nox ****

Nox was so very happy to be out from behind the wheel, he stretched his arms and legs as he got out.  A kid was just getting off a motorcycle and he looked very much like his father, Nox knew that had to be Cruz long before Dorian introduced them all.  Nox was surprised when Dorian put his arm around him.  He almost pulled away, but he explained that Cruz already knew.  And that was all Cruz needed to drag him into the house.

Cruz dropped Nox's arm once he was walking beside him without hesitation.  "You aren't much older than me are you?"

Nox laughed, "Couple years, that a problem?"

Cruz shook his head.  "No.  Was just curious."  Cruz opened the front door and there was a rustle of people in front of them.  Servants everywhere.  Cruz waved at the congregation of people cleaning, moving things, setting other things up, "For the ball, usually not so many people here.  Chritian needed help.  You are staying for the ball?"

Nox looked around in awe, "Yeah, I think so.  Your mother doesn't want us wandering around underdressed so I assume that means we are supposed to attend."

Cruz smiled, "I doubt you'd fit in any of Dad's.  You can look through older ones of mine."

Nox nodded, "I think that was your mother's plan."

A woman in a tiny red dress walked around a courner, the bright red lipstick standing out against her smooth skin and her dark hair framing her face.  Nox couldn't help but stare, her voice was highly Spanish accented, "His mother's plan for what?"

Nox grinned at her, "For dressing D's friends for the ball."

"My plan.  Ah..."  The woman looked Nox up and down.  

Before she could say anything more he was offering his hand, "Nox Durante.  You must be Anastasia Vega."  

She offered her hand in return, Nox took it and kissed her middle knuckle, "A pleasure."  He grinned back at her.

Cruz looked at him with a curious frown, Nox laughed.  "What?  I'm not doing anything wrong."

Dorian was chuckling behind him and he put his arm around Nox.  "Ana, this is Nox."

She smiled, "So he told me.  Your beau?  You bring one home for the first time in what 19 years?"

Nox grinned, "It wasn't intentional.  Before three days ago."  Nox waved at him and Dorian, "We didn't exist like this.  I didn't exist like this."

Dorian laughed, "Well that's one way to put it."

Cruz still looked confused and Nox sighed.  "I don't like guys." 

Dorian interrupted, "He's a ladies man, Cruz.  You will not be going anywhere with Nox Durante as your wing man.  Ever."

Nox leaned his shoulder into Dorian and bumped him, "Hey, I'm not that bad."

Dorian smiled, "Just don't teach my son to pick up girls the wrong way.  Please?"

Nox grinned, "Since you asked so nicely."  He leaned in and kissed Dorian quickly.  "Okay Cruz, let's go find something suitable to wear before you get me in more trouble."

Cruz grinned, "Or we can ..."  Dorian glared at his son and Nox laughed and put his arm around Cruz and whispered nothing really important into Cruz's ear and looked back at Dorian with a look that said that will teach you.

Nox heard Aria giggle, really giggle behind him.  Nox winked at her and turned back to push the act even farther with Dorian.

When they walked around a corner Nox dropped the act and smiled.  Cruz chuckled softly, "I like you."

Nox grinned and turned around and walked backwards.  "Likewise."  He bumped into a table and Nox could feel the contents on it shift and teater.  Nox caught his breath, "Fuck!"

Before Nox could react he felt a meanacing presence in front of him and Nox saw a weave of air extend from Cruz's outreached hands and catch whatever was about to fall on the floor.  Nox turned around and snatched the floral vase out of the air and set it back on the table.   _Fuck me!  Dorian's going to shit a brick._  Nox sighed and turned back to Cruz.  "We need to talk."

**** Aria ****

Aria had never seen a house like this.  The only thing as grand had been the Baccaratt mansion, but she'd never actually been in the mansion proper like.  This was huge, and elegant.  As was the owner.  Anastasia Vega came striding towards them in a red dress that hugged every part of her body.  Dorian would have been a lucky man if he'd liked women.  She was every bit the fashionista her mother was.  Aria smiled, Nox was however not Dorian and he could barely take his eyes off of her which confused Cruz to no end, and even after Nox claimed his disinterest in men Cruz was still confused, but they walked off together in whispers.

Dorian introduced Aria, "Ana, this is Aria Piccolo.  Nox's partner.  Aria, this is my wife Anastasia."

Aria nodded but didn't offer her hand.  The other woman frowned and Aria smiled, "I will refrain from shaking hands.  I could lie and say I was a germaphobe, but since you know what Dorian does.  Let's just say you and I will be more comfortable if I can't read you that well."

Vin stepped in and smiled at Anastasia, "She's an empath, physical contact makes the connection stronger.  Tonight she'll need gloves.  Right little song?"

Aria nodded, "Yes, I have a pair that will work provided the outfit chosen matches."

Anastasia smiled, "Surely you don't hunt with these men, you are so tiny."

Dorian laughed, "Oh she does my dear.  She does hunt with us.  She saved me last night I must admit."

Anastasia smiled, "Well I find it hard to beleive, but come with me dear, I'll find something for you to wear."  She wrapped an arm around Aria as she lead her way from Dorian and Vin.  She heard Vin laughed, "She's no idea what she's getting into."  Aria wasn't exactly which her she was referring to as she couldn't hear what Dorian said in response.

Aria walked beside Anastasia up the stairs, the second floor was only slightly less elegant than the main floor.  There was not a single stitch of carpet over the highly glossed floors, Aria was sure you could eat off of them.  

The woman beside Aria to her side, "You aren't much of a talker I see."

Aria laughed, "Not usually, most people tend to ignore me."

Anstasia shook her head, "That's such a loss.  Come, we will fix that at least for one night."  She opened a door into a very elegant room, the floors were all the same high polished wood as the rest of the house, but it was accented in reds and golds, Everything was in red and gold.  And it was just a sitting room, kinda like the suite they'd stayed in before.  Anastasia beckoned Aria to follow her into another room, and then through another set of doors.  Aria stopped dead in her tracks at the door way.  Inside was filled with clothes, lots and lots of fancy dresses, all hanging neatly, the perfect amount of space so the dresses could breathe, the far wall was a rotating showcase of shoes, and other accessories.  

The other woman looked at Aria with a sad smile, "Oh my poor dear, come on in.  I won't bite I promise."

Aria laughed, she could hear Nox's words clearly in her head, "Nox would tell you he wouldn't mind if you bit him."  Aria opted out of her telling her that she'd agree with his assessment.  

"You and he are close?" She asked as she was sorting through the dresses closes to her.

"As Dorian said, we are partners, and housemates and he's my best friend, despite the disfunction between him and my ... boyfriend."  That was the first time Aria had actually used the word herself.  Lucas was her boyfriend, good and truly, he knew everything now.  She smiled.

"Oh, fabulous.  Too bad your man could not be here to see you then.  We will have to get some good shots of you to show him.  We will make Nox see what he's missing."

Aria sighed, "He's not missing anything Ms. Vega.  It's a mutual decision.  And if anything were ever to happen between us, there would be no partnership left.  Nox isn't wired that way.  He can consider more with Dorian because Dorian is not female.  If it doesn't work with Dorian, Nox might not get to be happy before our job takes our lives."

Anastasia handed Aria stockings and other under garments, "Here, go take a shower, I'll have a dress ready when you get out."  Aria turned to find the bathroom off to the side of what she know beleived to be the dressing room.  "Oh and Aria."  Anastasia waited until she turned back around, "Please call me Ana."  She touched a hand to Aria's shoulder, "I'm sorry for implying Nox wanted more.  I just worry Dorian is in over his head with that one."

Aria laughed, "Ana, he is, but so is Nox.  Dorian can hold his own against Nox.  And they'll both be better people if it can make it through."

"You beleive that?"

Aria nodded, "Yes.  Nox is more than the obnoxious jerk you see on the outside.  He is the hero he pretends he's not.  Yes he's a jerk too, don't get me wrong.  But it's part of the way he was raised, like me, he was born into this.  Our social conventions aren't exactly normal."

Ana nodded, "You didn't choose to do this?"  Aria shook her head.  She asked more, "Nox either.  Why would your parents subject you to this life?"

Aria frowned, "My mother was killed because she went awol.  My father didn't know I existed until recently.  And I'm sure Nox's parents really didn't have a choice.  The American Atharim function much different than they do around the rest of the world.  They don't have a home, not head quarters, no place to return to.  It's life on the road.  At least I could call the Vatican home.  Nox and his sister didn't have that option."

"Such a sad life.  Shower, and we can discuss more things.  I will have things ready soon, don't be long."  Ana smiled and Aria turned and shut the door behind her, she wasn't sure she was going to like this at all but she'd give it a whirl.  Living life and all that.
