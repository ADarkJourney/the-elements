**** Martin ****

Dorian's words had crept into his head.  No matter how much he tried to be angry at his friend for suggesting that the little whelp of a girl who was also a monster was actually an asset, he couldn't find flaw in anything the report said, any report said.  She was pretty by the book.  

He would think on it.  Martin did have uses for her after all, maybe if Dorian was right, maybe she might work well, but that was for a latter date.  He had been sent a missive from some person or another stating that a well-to-do investor was looking for information that only Martin could give and to expect his call at 8am sharp.

And as Martin thought the caller was late.  It was now 8:30 when his wallet rang.  "Please hold, while I connect you to Mr. Gottschalk"

Martin knew that name, but he couldn't place it.  Martin waited for another five minutes and his temper started to raise when the familiar voice of JÃ¶rg Gottschalk spoke, "Mr. Borovsky, sorry to keep you waiting, it has been a good 10 years since we've had the pleasure of speaking."

"Mr. Gottschalk, my time is no more precious than yours, what is it can I do for you this early morning?" He tried not to sound irriated but the failure was evident in his voice.

"Right to the point," the voice on the other end of the phone said smuggly.  Martin thanked the heavens that he was not on video chat as he rolled his eyes.  "Well then, you've a team that is currently heading to the Netherlands?"  He didn't wait for Martin to answer, it seemed he already knew that answer  "I was hoping that you could send me details on that team.  I think I might have them look into something for me while they are there.  It is of Atharim interest of course, otherwise I would not ask.  But it's a matter than needs delicate hands."

Martin nodded, "Anyone could have gotten you that list and information."  Martin sighed, "No wait, sorry, Dorian's list is still sitting on this stack of paper."  He quickly threw the names and public file docets of each of the hunters on Dorian's team into a file and shot it over.  "Is there anything else?"

Martin could almost hear the man smile, "Can you give me a quick run down on these individuals.  Your opinion is highly valued over there in Moscow now I hear."

Martin laughed, "My opinion has been highly valued for years sir.  But fine I can give you a synopsis of the individuals.  Dorian Vega, I recruited him, I trained him.  He's an excellent hunter and leader despite his appearances.  He's not to be underestimated.  Excellent swordsman and marksman.  I trust him with my life."

"Vincent Auclair, also recruited and trained by me.  You sir, have encounter Auclair in the past, an artifact went missing from your residence, which we kindly returned.  He's an excellent burglar, swordsman, and in all circles known to be a bad man.  Stand clear of his triggers and you'll get along just fine with him.  He's not delicate as you would probably like but he's a good man to have in on a fight and if you need stealth he's your man."

"Antoinette Cailot, classically trained by Father Dimitri, she's a good long range gal to have along for the ride.  Experienced with hunting with Furia, and other similar abilites."  He didn't exactly want to tell this man, they had a monster working for them.  That would look bad.  Aria's public file still said Furia, and that's what he'd tell anyone who asked outside the small circle who already knew.  "She's highly skilled and well rounded.  She also speaks fluently several languages."

Martin sighed, "Aria Piccolo, Furia.  Good hunter, Excellent tracker.  She was classically trained by Father Dimitri but unlike most of his followers, prefers the swords to modern technology.  She has worked closely with Ms. Cailot in the past and speaks more languages than her. She's pretty close to a walking Atharim text book given the amount of time she's been studying in the Atharim."

"And finally Nox Durante, an American Hunter," Martin tried not to spit out the words, "also born into the school of Atharim.  Good record, excellent marksman.  Being American, newly indoctrinated into the organization he's a bit of an unknown with little record, he partners with Ms. Piccolo."  Martin flips through some of Dorian's notes concerning their last mission, "He seems to be well acquainted with technology uses and their application to our jobs."

On the other side of the phone Martin could hear the man breathing but that was the only indication he had been listening, "Very well," the caller sounded satisfied, "I will read the reports.  I assume contact information is available."

Martin nodded, "Of course.  They are on a critical mission and I would suggest sending Dorian a text and let him call you when they are not in the field."

Gottschalk ended the call with a quick thank you and until next time before hanging up his end of the call. 

**** Vincent ****

Vin decided to let Red drive while he got ready.  He wasn't the type of man who cared that the woman drove, he preferred not to anyway, driving required concentration and Vin was easily distracted.  So he had plenty of time to sit and think. 

He reminisced on Nox teaching Dorian how to use the land warriors. It was a trip watching Dorian, Vin was pretty sure Dorian had a bit more knowledge than that, but was playing it up, or down rather so that he could spend more time with Sparkler.  He smiled at that.  Sparkler.  It was the perfect nickname for the kid, he was a hot head, someone who was all show but he'd seen very little to back it up.  It fit, and the little song actually giggled at the name, he wondered why but it didn't matter really, he was happy with it.

They neared the residence of one Frida Thygesen.  The neighborhood was pretty much like any suburban neighborhood in the Netherlands, and pretty much anywhere else.  The houses were spaced close together, with drive ways and sidewalks separating the residences.  Little white picket fence streched in front of this particular development site.  It was quaint.

Red parked two blocks away from their intended location.  Night had fallen, but it was still early,  you could thank the shorter days of winter for that.  Thankfully it was not bitter cold, or Red might freeze her pretty little arse off out in the middle of this mission.  But really it was something everyone on the team except maybe D would be used too.  It still boggled his mind when he thought of the things D had come from, wealth and prestige.  But he was a good hunter, there was not doubt about that, even if he liked staying in fancy hotels, everyone had their own vices.

Vin skirted through the back alleyways between the rows of houses, more likely to get called on by the police if someone saw him lurking about, but it was also the least likely place to be seen.  Dressed in all black and wearing black face paint, Vin was ready to take a gander into the goddess living quarters.  He put on the goggles and found a small greeting from the little song on it.  She was manning the input for any disturbances and to send the calvary if necessary.  Not that Sparkler and D would be doing nothing while they were out hunting this goddess, they were tasked with checking out that mysterious warehouse.  Aria was with them, Vin didn't expect the goddess to be here.

And he was right, the house that she owned was dark inside.  It was too early for sleep, and probably even too early for the meteorologist to be home from her shift on the television station she worked for.  Vin crept up to the back door and when he found it locked he pulled out his tool kit and deftly picked the lock.  

The door knob turned smoothly but the door creeked as he opened it slowly.  It was a lot slower motion than he had anticipated to remain as quiet as he liked.  In his ear he heard Red yammering on about the heat sensors not working, everything looked like it was on fire.  Aria was trying to talk Red through the settings, and Vin had to turn off his ear peice as he went inside the building.  
His goggles were working fine, but then again he had night vision set and not heat, because well he was recording everything he saw in the house.  Nox said he hadn't needed to look at everything, that the software was good enough to pick out the important details.  The first floor was empty of all people, and really it didn't looked lived in at all.  It looked like a house he would keep, and did in France.  He never actually got to step foot in the place often, because he was rarely home, but he did take a month off here and there to kick back and chill out.  This house was devoid of personality, there were no pictures on the walls, the furniture looked like it was staged, there was no dust anywhere.

Vin never made it upstairs as he heard a loud thunderous noise, he could have sworn it was thunder itself, but there had not been a cloud in the sky.  Moments later he heard a load rush of something, he didn't know what it was. 

**** Antoinette ****

Outside the house a bush by the neighbors house was the perfect place to hide, she could easily see all of the goddess' house, her back was to a wall so no one could surprise her and it provided good cover from the street and from anyone inside either house.  She was going to be as invisible as Vin was supposed to be.

Antoinette had the land warriors on that Nox had gone over, she had them at optimal settings for both night vision and infrared.  However everything was looking too warm no matter how she adjusted the goggles everything seemed too warm, Vin was nearly invisible in the heat map.  The small ear buds that Dorian had handed out when they were in the room before he'd gotten all tech stupid with Nox.  She was still rolling her eyes at that.  He wasn't that daft, maybe he'd had too much to drink on the plane.  One could only hope.

But despite the young man's complete lack of observation when it came to Dorian, he was rather savvy with what he did know.  And she wished she had him on the other side of the coms instead of Aria.  Aria was with Dorian and Nox as they scouted the warehouse, but she was monitoring their coms and the feeds from the land warriors.  

Aria insisted, "The land warriors don't do that when the settings are messed up.  It's either on or off, something has to be changing the atmosphere."

Antoinette knew it was a possiblity, like when the heat came on in the winter, everything warmed up.  But this wasn't like that, it was consistant, everything in the vicinity of the house was too warm.  

While she played with the settings Vin went into the house with absolutel quiet and stealth, Antoinette would have been impressed if it were not for the annoying girl in her ear telling her that something was wrong at the place.  Aria voice had gone cold and distant, "Get out of there.  I think she's there."

Antoinette shrugged and took raised the landwarriors to look at the house.  She couldn't see Vin anymore, the heat sensors were working to a degree.  But here view didn't last long as someone sneered down at her.  There was a crash and a bright light and the last thing Antoinette heard was Aria's cold voice telling Vin to get out.
