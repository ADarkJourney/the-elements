**** Dorian ****

Their afternoon consisted of pretty much the same thing their morning did.  Except that they were off doing their own things.  Vin and Aria were sparring in the gym downstairs, Dorian found it odd that the two had taken to each other so well, but then again, they were kindred spirits, they had been when in the Vatican as well.  Only Martin had never truly allowed fraternization outside his own circle of recruits and teams.  

Nox was continually surprising him, and his willingness to tell him personal things made it all the better, he knew more about him in the past day than he'd known by reading his file, and the file was fairly well detailed.  Though there was one side affect to that, the more he learned of Nox, the more he wanted to be with him, and Nox wasn't ready for more.  But Dorian could wait.  It had been a while since anyone had inspired that reaction.  

He and Nox spent time alone up stairs in his rooms, more playing with the weapons in the bags, Nox going through things he knew about gods, himself included, and those he'd met in person, and those that Aria had met.  At first Dorian had wanted to be left in the dark about what those two were doing, but really he wanted to understand what made this man he was getting involved with tick.  And Nox was more than willing to share.  He offered up information, suggestions, what was starting to bother Dorian was the sheer amount of thought he and Aria had put into learning how to kill a god.  This was his kind, and he was preparing for war against them.  It was a conflict of interest.

Dorian couldn't hold the questions in any longer, Nox was sorting through one of Dorian's bags on the side of the mat and Dorian was sitting against the wall watching him.  It was nice to just sit and listen for a change, but he had to know, "You are hunting your kind?  Why?"

Nox looked up from the gun he had been holding with a grin, "We aren't learning to hunt gods."  When he spoke of hunting he always used we, meaning he and Aria, they were more a team in this than any Dorian had ever seen.  There were teams that worked together all the time, Martin, Vin and Dorian had all been a pretty standard team at one point in time.  But not always, Aria and Nox worked together, one was never with out the other now.  Nox continued oblivious to Dorian's thoughts, "We are trying to find a way to kill one god in particular."  
Dorian nodded, "Ascendancy."  He'd figured that out a while ago.  The way they spoke of hunting gods, they were hunting the impossible.  And yet they both worked towards that goal, knowing Aria's death was going to go down with that one hunt, either Ascendancy killed her or her usefullness would be at an end, ether way she was dead.

Nox nodded, "So we learn to kill gods.  I was worried when Aria first told me about it.  If she could hunt Ascendancy, she could hunt me.  And then she asked me to kill her if she went bad, went rogue and started killing innocents again.  And I realized that her knowing how to kill me was probably a good thing."  Nox grinned at Dorian, "I'm sure there are some people who could easily manipulate me to their way of thinking. Show me things I could do with the power inexchange for services rendered.  I can be manipulated, I can be what I don't want to be.  At least now, I have a failsafe."

Dorian nodded, "And if a war comes?"

Nox laughed, "It has already come, just no one has really esclated it.  Commander Vellas, one of Ascendancy's right hand men is a god, the video's were not faked.  The man is a great tactician and a god.  And Aria knows him.  She's actually contacted him on several occassions, well once anyway to discuss issues."  Nox grinned, "He knows what Aria is sent to do.  And Aria, " Nox paused, "And I, have met Ascendancy.  War against the Atharim is already waged, just the battles are small.  I know my side.  And it's not Atharim, and it's not the side of the gods, this is not a two front battle.  There is no black and white."

"I will fight for what I beleive in.  Monsters are here, some gods are monsters, just like some people are monsters.  I will hunt down and kill any god that is a threat.  I will not hunt down a god who is just healing the innocent.  But along the way, I may have to kill a good god so that I can survive another day.  It is what Aria beleives and I agree with her whole heartedly.  I will help gods get away from the Atharim.  I will save those I can, I will teach those who need it.  I will kill those who deserve it."

Dorian shook his head, "So young and so much resolve to do the right thing."  Dorian smiled, "I wish I had that much of a cause at your age.  I don't have that much of a cause at my age."

Nox smiled but Dorian continued, "I just wanted to do anything to piss my father off.  I created means to do what I wanted, what I thought I needed to do to gain his approval.  It's all I've ever done.  I sit here and listen to you and you were born in to this life.  The world has been nothing but hunting and killng for you, and you thrive in the mere conflict of it.  You become a monster and your ideals still hold to what is the core fundamental values of the Atharim, to protect the innocent.  Zealots will reign but you beleive in your cause, I am in awe."

Nox laughed, "D, there is nothing to be in awe of.  You are here.  You've yet to kill me.  I'm rambling about how we aren't going to do our mission, about saving gods, you have more ammo than you need to condemn me to my own death, and you sit here and listen and you are inspired by what I say, not because I said them, or I beleive them.  You know it to be true."

Dorian shook his head, "You underestimate the power you have."

Nox laughed, "No D, I don't.  I know what affect I have on you.  This is beyond that.  You..."  Dorian closed the distance between them before the sentence was out of Nox's mouth and kissed him.  Dorian whispered, "No more words."  He stood up and took Nox's hands and lead him to his bedroom and closed the door.  Nox never hesitated, but Dorian reassured him, "You are going to drive me crazy and I think that will be more than fine."  Dorian kissed Nox and tugged at his shirt.  

They hadn't even made it to the bed before a knock sounded on the door outside.  Nox laughed, "And so the bell tolls."  

Dorian frowned, "I suppose this will have to wait till later."  Dorian could see the smart comment just on the tip of Nox's tongue, he wasn't going to say it for the knowledge that it would make Dorian want him more.  He could see the humor playing across his lips and through his eyes.  "Well spit it out."

Nox laughed, "And I..."  Dorian put his finger to his lips and Nox kissed it softly with a wink and a grin.  He'd been played again, he didn't intend to say much, only make Dorian react.

Dorian shook his head and walked into the other room and opened the door, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on in.  We'll start rolling as soon as lover boy in there gets dressed."

Vin's jaw dropped and he laughed as he saw Nox tugging his shirt on over his head.
