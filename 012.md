**** Aria ****

Aria woke up while it was still dark.  Nox had apparently not gone to bed, he was a constant dull echo in her head, which in itself was good, she hadn't had any nightmares.  She woke to voices in the other room and her wallet missing.

Aria got up and took a shower and got into clean clothes, eventually everything would need to be washed.  She was wearing her favorite shirt, two stick figures one saying "Don't Worry, I got your back!" while holding the other's back - literally.  It made her smile, and it was the only shirt she owned with a saying.  

Aria left her weapons where they'd spent the night and walked out to the other room to find food, Vin and Nox chatting away about something.  Nox was the first to look up and he grinned as he read her shirt, "I love that shirt."

Vin looked over and smiled, "So very much not the little song.  But I like it."

Nox laughed, "Oh it's her, you just don't know her well enough.  I got breakfast this morning.  I beat you to it."

Aria frowned, "But you didn't sleep any Nox."

He got up and poured another cup of coffee, "I'm good, I got coffee."  Aria shook her head and made a plate.

"What ya'll got going here?"  She sat down in front of the holo screens and saw that the rendering was complete, and still searching databases.  "How long has it been going?"

Nox shrugged, "Since you went to bed I suppose.  He must be hard to find."

Aria felt Dorian wake up with a headache, "Dorian needs some OJ I think, did you think to get some?"

Nox nodded and poured a cup and a cup of coffee, "Yeah I knew he'd be feeling it this morning."

Dorian staggered out with his hand to his head in just his jeans. It was the first time Aria had seen Dorian without his shirt, the black tattoo that covered half his body was impressive.  She smiled as Dorian spoke, "Damn!  But you guys are loud and the coffee smells good."  Aria saw Nox watching Dorian, she wasn't sure what he was feeling as he had grabbed the power and hid from her, he was being protective of his emotions this morning.

Vin was watching them too, Aria could feel him holding back his comments.  She wondered what Vin and Nox had talked about.

Nox pointed to the cups sitting on the table, "You probably want both of those."

Dorian smiled and took the coffee mug in his hands and smiled, "Thanks."  He drank nearly the whole thing before he fixed a plate and sat down next to Aria and looked at the image on the holos.  He frowned, "I know him."

He had everyone's attention, and he smiled as he made them wait.  He took a bite of bacon and several swallows of orange juice before he continued on.  He was as bad as Nox, Aria thought.  "He works for my father.  I don't know what he does..."  Dorian paused as Nox stopped the search and changed a few parameters around on the holo screen, and three seconds later the image of Mat√≠as Villegas popped up on another holo screen with everything they ever wanted to know about him.  Dorian smiled, "Damn!  You know what you are doing on that."

Nox shrugged, "Only narrowed the search is all.  Nothing overly complicated."

Aria laughed, "Yeah, and he's no hero either."  Nox stuck his tongue out her but the others just staired at them like they were crazy.  Aria wasn't going to explain, they'd find out soon enough.  She asked the next obvious question, "So do we go after him, and hope he's with our weather goddess since they are obviously working together?  Or do we stay here and look for her?"

Nox flipped through a few more screens and smiled, "We go for him.  He went back home to Spain it seems."  On the screen was him and their air goddess on a security camera at an airport entering a gate for Madrid.  Nox sighed and Aria could feel the terror building inside, he knew what that meant.

But Dorian grinned, "How about a road trip?"  He rolled his eyes, "I'll survive a few nights on the ground or cheap motel if I have to.  But I don't think Nox will survive another plane ride."

Nox relaxed visibly, "Are you sure?"

Dorian nodded, "Yeah.  I'll be fine, promise."  He smiled.

Nox laughed, "Ain't you a doll?"  

Dorian's smile widened then quickly turned down, "I suppose I should let Anastasia know we are coming, and to expect guests.  I don't want to get yelled t."  He got up with a sigh.  "Leave before checkout, and use the rentals.  I'll have to call about that."  

Vin laughed, "I can do that, you call the wifey and I'll handly the SUVs.  I think I can pretend to be Mr. Vega."

It seemed they had a plan of action now.  Aria supposed that was a good thing, they were going to Madrid, she hadn't been there before.  

**** Vincent ****

No one really got that much sleep, nightmares and kisses seemed to be taking up most of everyone's night time slumbers.  He didn't envy Sparkler his dilemia not that Vin would have doubts about his reactions.  But he wasn't the kid, and he seemed to be a bit confused by it all.

Vin had taken on the chore of arranging to keep one SUV for their trip from Amsterdam to Madrid.  It wasn't overly difficult to pretend to be Dorian.  He had all the pertenant information and since Dorian was made of money, the company he used was used to dealing with his personal help.  Not that Dorian had any when he worked, just when he was at home and the butler or other staff could see to it for him.

Dorian had a driver for the SUV but they didn't need him for the trip down, and they hadn't had one before, he put the three of them on the insurance, Vin knew little song didn't drive, it was on of those things that had come up over the course of basic conversation with Sparkler while they avoided the topic of Dorian.

He'd met Dorian's family once.  His was was drop dead gorgous it was such a waste that Dorian wasn't attracted to her in the least.  But he'd heard it told she was screwing the butler or something.  Vin couldn't imagine a Jarvis or a Alfred boning some guys wife.  But there it was.  Though Dorian insisted that Christian was worthy of Ana's lust.  And he'd know, Vin laughed at his own thoughts.

Once everything was arranged Vin got his gear together and packed in their cases.  He really hadn't used much.  He had a small panic attack, he hadn't gotten the prior days clothes cleaned and he had to mentally prepare for that when they hit Madrid, things were going to be different while they clearly stayed on Dorian's estate.  To live the life of a king.  Now that was going to be interesting to say the least.

Aria and Nox were busy putting their gear away, it seemed to be strewn all over the common room, their gear being all the tech stuff that they used regularly.  He was impressed truly with their getup.  It made most of his prior hunts feel seriously lacking.  Days and days spent doing research following dead end leads.  And here they spent even less time doing that and they were already well on their way to hunting down not one but two gods.

Vin rounded up a cart to carry all their gear down to the SUVs.  The bellhop wasn't happy he'd snagged it and insisted on pushing it where he was going.  Something about hotel policy.  Vin sneered at the impossibly rich people policies.  Annoying is what it was.

He arranged his gear once the cart ws in their suite and he was set to go he sat back down on the couch and downed a few more cups of coffee before the started the drive.

**** Nox ****

Aria had woken up and wore the only shirt he'd ever seen her in that had anything on it.  It was one of his favorites and not because of the way it hugged her body, all her clothes did that.  

Vin had laughed, he seemed more friendly now.  Almost like a weight had been lifted.  Maybe it had, he'd sparred with Aria without weapons, maybe all that holding back had made him hold back from everything.

But it was Dorian walking out with out his shirt that caught Nox's attention.  The night before still played still frame in his mind.  The kiss, touching Dorian's chest, the way he'd reacted, but Dorian didn't seem to notice Nox staring, and he hadn't even really looked at him.  Nox felt a stab of disappointment.

Nox had only half heard the conversation, but he realized that he could narrow the search and set to wrking it out.  With a new plan laid out they each went to do their own duties.  Aria helped him with the computer set up, she didn't say anything, their conversation last night before she'd gone to bed had been short.  He had told her about the kiss, but that was the extent of it.  She looked like she wanted to say something, he whispered softly to her as he knelt beside the computer she was meticulously shutting down.  "Spit it out."

Aria looked at him and shook her head, "I can't."

Nox bundled up the cords before he looked up at her, "Why not?"

Aria smiled, and leaned in and planted a kiss on his temple.  "Because if I say anything to you, it'll make matters worse.  I know you.  I feel the tight knot inside you are trying to untagle.  If I tell you what he feels then it'll tie you back up.  If I try to decipher what you feel, I'll only make you doubt yourself."  She put a hand on his arm with a smile, "Nox, it's real no matter what it looks like.  Happiness does not come in a predefined package."

She left him with those parting words, taking the cords from him and carrying the laptop away to put it in it's bag.  Nox sighed.  Vin took that moment to sit down with coffee and Nox joined him.  

Vin grinned knowingly, "I remember my first crush."

Nox turned to look at him over the coffee mug, Vin continued, "She was a sweet girl, red head, carefree and a spit fire, not much unlike Red really."  Nox heard the note of sadness in his voice, "Sadly it wasn't meant to be.  The only girl for with whom I ever considered stopping what I do for a living."

Nox frowned, "Yeah, I don't do this....Ever.  Never crushed on a girl.  Now..."  he left the words unspoken but they rattled off in his head, _now I'm crushing on a guy._

Vin patted Nox on the shoulder, "Neither had I, neither had I.  Guys like us don't do normal.  I can tell you one thing though, it's not normal for either one of you."

Dorian choose that moment to come out, fully dressed, though he had changed clothes and loaded his things on to the cart.  Then sat on the arm of the couch next to Nox, "We have something to discuss before we go."

**** Dorian ****

Dorian woke up to voices.  His head hurt, despite the feigned drunken behavior from the diluted wine he'd passed off as real wine, he still had a hang over.  Nox hadn't rejected him.  He'd returned the kiss, and he probably would have continued farther along if Dorian hadn't gotten impatient and tugged at him.  If anything the boy had a moral code.  He didn't do drunken one nightstands, and for that Dorian was grateful.  He had almost asked him to stay the night, nightmare abounded and he'd woken several times in a sweat.  Images of death were like that.  Even if it was a monster, Dorian still had nightmares of the ghoulish things he'd seen in the course of his life time.

There was no point in getting more dressed, his jeans were already wrinkled and he needed a shower, but the coffee smelled so good.  When he opened the door, he saw Nox watching him.  He'd poured juice and coffee, Dorian had made it a point not to show him any additional favor.  It was truly excruciating, but he managed to make it through their brief conversation before he got up to call Ana.

Dorian went into his bedroom and closed the door behind him, then went into the bathroom and turned on the shower, at the very least it added to the privacy but warmed the water for a quick shower afterwards.

Ana answered, "Why are you calling so early in the morning Dorian?"

Dorian laughed, "I'm sorry.  Out working, time has no meaning when you spend the night up most of it."  Dorian could almost hear her eyes rolling, he grinned, "I've buisness in Madrid, I have three others with me.  With this be a problem?"

"When you expect to arrive?"  She didn't sound like it was a good idea.

"Two days.  We are in Amsterdam and driving."

"Why on earth are you doing that?  How long are you staying?"

Dorian laughed, "One of my companions freaks out while flying.  And I'd rather not have a hunter on rare nerves around my father.  My companion has bit of temper that is not palatable by my father, nor is his brand of humor."

Ana laughed, "Ah, well in two days your father is hosting a grand ball at the estate.  Your friends will be required to look the part, if they can manage that.  I know your friends are rarely suited for such situations.  But if that is your timeline, then you will need to be prepared."

Dorian sighed, "Is it that time of year again?  Expect us in two days.  I have a small lady with me, size 4 probably, can you see that we have something for her, I'm sure that Cruz and I can find appropriate attire for the two men."

Ana nodded, "What lucky girl gets to hang out with three burly men?"

Dorian smiled, "Oh, she can handle herself Anastasia, my dear, she's much like you in that regard, very in control."

"I will tell Cruz you are coming home then.  He... No We, look forward to your visits home."  Ana said almost lovingly.

"I miss the lot of you all greatly as well.  It will be good to home even if I have to work."  Dorian bid his wife farewell, then jumped into the shower.  He wasn't looking forward to the ball, it was a fundraiser for local charities that helped the poor with medical expenses.  The high and mighty buying a ticket to the grand ball for the occassion, all proceeds going to the charity, my father donating the time and money to host it.  It was one of his many charities, and it was always a good time - dancing, drinking and social networking - all under the guise of the perfect son.  Dorian had to put that face on now, this was going to go badly if he intended to persuade Nox into anything more than just a kiss.  Dorian wasn't even sure Nox was interested, even with the returned kiss.  How he wanted more...

Dorian finished his shower and pulled on fresh jeans and a clean t-shirt.  

He sat down next to Nox on the arm of the couch declaring the need for a discussion.  "My father is hosting a grand ball at the family estate.  There is no need for hotels and such there is more than enough room there.  However, it is on the day we will arrive.  All of you will need to look the part."

Vin was the first to respond, "How terribly inconvient, we get to attend a grand ball?"  He was grinning madly.  "I don't know whatever will we do?  Your wife said it was okay for you to bring home kids to play with at her fancy party?"

Dorian laughed, "She will have attire for Aria ready to go through, and Cruz and I should be able to find suitable attire for you two."  Dorian put his hand on Nox's shoulder and Nox visible relaxed, Dorian didn't look down at him, but maybe he shouldn't have ignored him so much earlier.  Dorian was sure he wasn't supposed to hear the sigh of releif under Nox's breath, but he had, but he didn't let Nox know he knew.  But Dorian's heart raced with excitement.

**** Aria ****

For once Aria knew how uncomfortable Nox felt around her and Lucas.  But it wasn't because of the cuddling and the physical contact, both Nox and Dorain emoted at her with reckless abandon.  Neither of them could help it, but she had to envelope herself into nothingness just to be in the same room with them.

Aria wasn't excited about the prospects of a grand ball.  As a matter of fact she was down right dreading it.  Aria hated dressing up, she felt so uncomfortable and out of place, if felt like people stared at her, and those that knew her usually did.  It made everything worse in the long run.  She would have been happier in the woods alone and dying that around a bunch of stuffy people all dressed in their finest, but she didn't object.  She just frowned and smiled weakly at the men.  It was not going to be a fun night.  But at least they weren't flying and Nox wouldn't be a mess. Not that he wasn't right now anyway.  

The SUV was packed, Dorian and Vin went to gas up and gather a few camping supplies, it was something none of them bought.  Nox took up the helm to get food for the trip.  Dorian had paled when Vin suggested he got with Nox.  Aria could feel the fear that hid behind his smile.  Nox had been disappointed, but it was never seen either.  Aria shook her head and Vin just grinned at her.  Maybe they'd figure it all out soon enough.

She and Nox got the basic staples of camping, at least by Nox's standards.  There was beer, a little higher in quality than he'd have purchased normally.  Nox would have made steaks but on a potential campfire that wasn't likely to do well so he opted for hamburgers and all the fixings.  He also picked up what he could for s'mores he called them.  He was treating this like some American camp out and intended to show off.  Aria wondered if it was for the benefits of Dorian, but it was probably not the case, he did pretty much the same thing at home.  They also grabbed a case of water bottles.  One could only hope that Dorian and Vin got a cooler, as Nox picked up a few bags of ice as well.

Aria sent Dorian a text when they were waiting in the queue to get out of the place.  Nox was babbling on about something, he enjoyed camping, he got to do it so little in Moscow, Aria thought she'd have to let him take her out more, to hunt real wild monsters.

Dorian and Vin met them at the entrance, the back was full of more things than they probablly needed for one night, but Dorian was a man of leisure and Aria had to laugh.  Vin was driving, Dorian sat in the passenger seat as Nox loaded the cooler Aria got into the SUV back seat.  Dorian turned around and smiled back at her, "He's excited."

Aria laughed, "You've no idea, it's been months since he's been out in the woods."

Dorian nodded, "Glad to give him the chance then, though we'll see if I come to regret it."

Aria looked back at Nox loading the last of things in the back and turned back to see Dorian watching him, "I doubt you'll regret it, he's a fabulous cook, and he's in his element out there."

Dorian looked at her assessing what she'd just said and a tinge of red hit his ears and vanished, "So all about him, you think?"

Vin leaned into the middle and whispered, "D, you know you are doing this all for him, so stop playing that you aren't."

Dorian turned around with a huff, but Aria could feel that he was happy inside.  Aria couldn't help but smile as Nox pulled into the seat next to her, "We are set.  Anything else?"

Vin nodded, "One more thing..." He turned on the radio, "We just all have to agree."

Aria laughed, "I abstain, I'm going to sleep."  Aria slipped her headset on and leaned on the door and closed her eyes.  She could near nothing more than the music in her ears as she drifted into the emptiness.
