**** Dorian ****

Antoinette had backed down just as the last party member joined up.  She was a touch looking woman.  One Dorian was sure he didn't want to mess with, her reputation spoke for itself.  He smiled at her comment and rolled his eyes at Nox's.  He really did have a knack for killing the tension.  It was probably a good thing he was around, even if it were only for the comedic relief.  Though if a good hunter like Aria trusted him with her life, he had to be worth more than that and his little toys he brings to the table.  But Dorian had yet to figure exactly what it was that he brought.  He would find it. But he expected a great deal of the respect that Aria had for him was the fact that he was protective of her.  And that was clearly obvious to anyone here.  Not that he posed much of a problem, it made him all the more curious as to why Aria had chosen such a skinny kid to watch her back there were far better warriors than him.

Vincent spoke of the past deeds, of death of a monster at his hands and Aria shared her own, which had taken him by surprise.  He'd seen the most recent report of Giordano Pirozzi in her files.  It was her last report, after Martin had sent her to Siberia, it hadn't been long she was a busy girl.  Martin didn't even have any comments attached to it.  But in that report no where had it said he was her father.  Martin had to be in a lather, he'd missed Giordano, he'd killed his daughter though.  That had only been a secondary win.  

Martin underestimated her, no the Regus did, the Regus put her on this death sentence, but she was going to take down every monster she could between now and then.  And he respected that.  And Vincent now got it.  Antoinette still spit venom whenever she looked at the back of her fallen comrade.  Dorian could see the hatred of what she was, not of the girl.  There were still moments of warmth in her eyes.  Maybe it could be salvaged.  But he doubted it.  Atharim beleived in one thing and one thing alone - the destruction of monsters.  And by all terms Aria was a monster.  

But here that monster walked, talked and breathed Atharim more so than all other's here, except maybe Jacinda.  That woman looked as scary as her report said she was.

The little restuarunt was small on the outside and the man who greeted them did so with gusto.  He hugged Antoinette, an old friend.  Dorian had met him once.  It was no surprise when he took Aria into his arms and hugged her too him with the grandoise kiss on each cheek.  They rattled off a quick conversation in Italian, he caught most of it, but there were a few parts that could be interrpeted differently.  Victor, the owner, and greeter apparently grasped Nox on the shoulder and shook his other hand.  

The brief conversation had included who Dorian was, and that they needed someplace quiet and out of the way to lay way plans.  Victor had called out to some girls in the back working and gave a bell yell for Marco.  

Victor greeted everyone else with less gusto until he came to stand in front of Dorian.  A prooffered hand was extended and Dorian shook with just enough streght to indicate he wasn't going to play games.  Victor smiled and asserted his own strength, it was not a power play so much as a sign of respect.  He wasn't sure he liked what Aria had said about him now.  Victor smiled, "Aria tells me that you have the expenses for this lavous breakfast."

Dorian laughed, "She said lavous did she?"

Victor shook his head, "No, I assume Nox talked you into coming here, free food and all."

Dorian was surprised, "Free food?"

Victor smiled, "For Aria and her friends, it brings her back.  The only issue that might present is that for free Marco gets to cook what he wants.  But you won't be disappointed.  Anything ordered specifically we do charge, Aria and Nox come often for the free food.  Marco is in heaven."

Dorian laughed.  "Free it is then.  But yes, I have the expenses.  We don't need much privacy, we should be done by the time you are good and ready to open."

Victor laughed, "No rush on our account.  Aria is family.  We've no parties this afternoon, you can use the large space."

Dorian bowed his head slightly, "If that is what you wish.  I do have one request.  Wine.  We need lots of it I think.  Probably a few beers for the rest, I'm sure their pallets are not as refined as mine."  

Dorian heard Nox laugh at his comment, "Got that damn straight.  None of that frufru for me, Thank you."  The grin on his face spoke volumes, he was not aiming the comment at Dorian, he was looking directly at the man in a crisp white apron and poofy chef's hat walking towards them.  Marco watched Nox with eyes that stalked it's prey and Nox grinned back like a fool who didn't know what stalked him.  Oblivious to the other man's attentions.  Was it really so easy to be ignored by the boy?  Maybe getting caught was the better approach.

He pushed the thoughts from his head.  "Marco I presume.  I've heard nothing but the best."

He pshawed at his commment with a wave of his hand, that spoke more words about the men he liked than about anything else, he was openly gay.  Dorian was not that open, though most people figured it out pretty quickly.  "I am he, and Aria speaks in truths, always."

That put Nox into a laugh too, "They don't know that yet Marco, you are giving away our secrets.  I wanted to see what the blunt truth would do some of these stick in the muds."

Marcon eyes Nox with a frown, "Next time, Durante."  He nearly spit the words out like it was an insult, but that was not what his eyes said, "you should speak first and let me open my mouth last."  Aria hid a smile behind her hand.  Dorian could only guess what she thought was funny.  Nox's respons was only to laugh. Oh the boy was so oblvious, Dorian thought just as Nox wrapped his arm around Aria like she was a shield, maybe not so oblivious.  He clung to familiarity.  There might be hope.

Victor saw the six of them into a fairly large room with casual seating at one end and a large table on the other.  Dorian smiled as the wine was plaed at the head of the table.  A single glass was poured by a pretty little thing that smiled brightly at him with a look that said she'd like to see more.  Dorian could only smile and thank her as he took the goblet from her hand and sipped at the wine.  A good vintage.  Didn't matter.  

Dorian pulled Nox away from Aria.  "Your wallet better or the same as Aria's?"

Nox shrugged, "You need it?  Aria's is older model, my holo's are better, but Aria's has all the cool toys."

Dorian smiled.  "You don't have all the cool toys?  I'm surprised."

Nox grinned at him, "She's the planner.  I use my laptop for the boring crap.  I don't keep it on me."

Dorian nodded in understanding, "Will she lend it to you?"

Nox held up a finger and walked over to Aria.  He causally wrapped his arms around her and pulled the wallet from her back jeans pocket where it had been hiding. As he was walking away with it she only turned and looked at him with a hey what the hell look on her face until she saw him walking back towards him.  Dorian shook his head as she turned around and listened to Victor's animated tale.  "I suppose you do that often?"

Nox just smiled as he started flipping through Aria's wallet.  "What ya need?"

Dorian smiled, "What do you have?"

Nox sat down at the head of the table and Dorian leaned over his shoulder and watched every flick of his hand, ever movement he made through the screens.  "Here is the 3D map app."  He put it up on a holo screen, while he continued to work on the wallet itself.  "Here is the Atharim DB that we can access while in public."  That flew up on to another holo screen.  Nox made one final swipe and a bulletin board type system flew up on the screen.  "This is Aria's favorite app.  You can drop any screen into it, and then position it and use it like Tony Stark."  Dorian looked at Nox in confusion.  He laughed, "Comic book reference, Begin of the century pop culture reference.  Big time tech mogule who played at being superhero.  Talking computer with 3D holo screens beyond his time.  Aria's favorite movies.  But then again that was the era of movie reels she got stuck in one day so I assume that's why."

"Stuck?"  Dorian would like to hear that story one day.  

Nox grinned, "I'll tell you when we don't have eyes watching every move I make.  Ya'll got history, us American's got a bit to work on I think."

Dorian sighed, "You have nothing to worry about."

Nox laughed, "Oh I don't do I?  You and Aria got my back?"  He looked up and winked at Dorian.  

"Something like that, Nox Durante, son of Bryan.  You have history.  I met your father once.  I'll tell you about it sometime."

Nox nodded, "Your seat."  He got up and gestered with a great sweeping flourish.  He was always the clown.  But it was good to have one like him around, he was right about one thing, every Atharim before him that he'd met were all sticks in the mud.

Dorian took a few minutes to orient himself with the holo screens.  Beginning soon would be grand, but food came first, both he and Vincent were salivating after starting on a beer that had just arrived.
